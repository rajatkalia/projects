This book is a plethora on Graphs.
 Usually this topic , i.e.
 graphs is studied with lots of hype in Coachings but unfortunately , not
 lots of good study material is available.
 This book fulfills a long felt need by students and teachers for an authorative
 text on graphs.
 For the sake of quantity of the number of graphs, Extended First Edition
 and Second Edition have been completely added in this text.

\begin_layout Standard
A graph is an accurate pictorial representation of data.
 The accuracy of data in physics requires that graphs be made on good quality
 graph paper.
 Nearly all graphs in physics are smooth line graphs; broken line (connect
 the dots) graphs and bar graphs are seldom appropriate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The style and format of a graph will depend upon its intended purpose.
 Three types are common in physics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 PICTORIAL GRAPHS.
 These are the kind found in mathematics and physics textbooks.
 Their purpose is to simply and clearly illustrate a mathematical relation.
 No attempt is made to show data points or errors on such a graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 DISPLAY GRAPHS.
 These present the data from an experiment.
 They are found in laboratory reports, research journals, and sometimes
 in textbooks.
 They show the data points as well as a smooth line representing the mathematica
l relation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 COMPUTATIONAL GRAPHS.
 These are drawn for the purpose of extracting a numerical result from the
 data.
 An example is the calculation of the slope of a straight line graph, or
 its intercepts.

Certain informational and stylistic features are required in all graphs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 The graph must have a descriptive title or caption, clearly stating what
 the graph illustrates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Data points are plotted as small dots with a sharp pencil, or as pinpricks.
 Some method should be used to emphasize the location of the points, for
 example, a neat circle drawn around each point.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A French curve is a template usually made from metal, wood or plastic composed
 of many different curves.
 It is used in manual drafting to draw smooth curves of varying radii.
 The shapes are segments of the Euler spiral or clothoid curve.
 The curve is placed on the drawing material, and a pencil, knife or other
 implement is traced around its curves to produce the desired result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Modern computer-aided design (CAD) systems use vector-based graphics to
 achieve a precise radius, so no template is required.
 Digital computers can also be used to generate a set of coordinates that
 accurately describe an arbitrary curve, and the points can be connected
 with line segments to approximate the curve with a high degree of accuracy.
 Some computer-graphics systems make use of Bézier curves, which allow a
 curve to be bent in real time on a display screen to follow a set of coordinate
s, much in the way a French curve would be placed on a set of three or four
 points on paper.

 The curve should stand out clearly.

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Choose scales that are convenient to plot and easy to read.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Choose scales such that the graph occupies most of the page.
 The two scales need not have the same size units.
 Also, the scales need not begin at zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Indicate the name, letter symbol and units of each variable plotted on
 each axis.

\begin_layout Standard
PHYSICAL SLOPE AND GEOMETRIC SLOPE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slope.
 When textbooks refer to the "slope" of a plotted graph line we mean the
 "physical slope"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
physical slope = 
\begin_inset Formula $\dfrac{\text{Δ}y}{\text{Δ}x}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where Δy and Δx are expressed in the physical units of the x and y axes.
 This slope has physical significance in describing the physical data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Geometric slope.
 A line which makes a 45° angle with an axis will not necessarily have a
 physical slope of size 1.
 Some authors introduce the term "geometric slope" to describe the tilt
 of the line on the page.
 This is a ratio of lengths of the legs of the triangle, without reference
 to the units plotted on the axes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is seldom (probably never) any need to calculate the geometric slope
 of a line on a graph.
 The idea is only useful when describing the appearance of the graph on
 the page.
 One rule of graph construction states that the graph should occupy most
 of the page.
 For square graph paper this suggests a geometric slope of 45°.
 See Fig 1-1 for examples of good and bad choices of geometric slope.

Nothing should be in the white margins except a page number.

Graphical Representation of Uncertainties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Display graphs and computational graphs should clearly show the size of
 the experimental uncertainties (errors) in each plotted point.
 There are several conventional ways to do this, the commonest being the
 use of error bars illustrated below:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plotted point is represented as a dot, and the range of uncertainty
 is shown by the extent of the bars on either side.
 The types shown in (a) are suitable where the error is entirely in one
 variable, or where the errors in both variables have been lumped together.
 The types shown in (b) are preferred where it is necessary to show the
 error in each variable explicitly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the uncertainties have a symmetric distribution about the mean, the
 error bars extend equally on either side of the points.
 If the data distributions are not symmetric, the plotted points will not
 be centrally located in the range of uncertainty and the error bars might
 look like those in Figure.
 part (c).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Error bars may not be necessary when the data points are so numerous that
 their scatter is clearly shows the uncertainty.
 In these cases error bars would clutter the graph making it difficult to
 interpret.
 Another situation where error bars are inapprop- riate is when the scale
 of the graph is such that the bars would be very small.
 In this case, it may be possible to indicate the uncertainty by the size
 of the circle or rectangle surrounding each point.

Curve Fitting
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Curve Fitting
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curve drawn through plotted data need not pass exactly through every
 data point.
 But usually the curve should pass within the uncertainty range of each
 point, that is, within the error bars, if the bars represent limits of
 error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One principle of curve fitting is also a fundamental rule of science itself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume the simplest relation consistent with the data.
 We are not justified in assuming a more complex relation than can be demonstrat
ed by the data.
 If a curve were drawn with detail smaller than the data uncertainty, that
 detail would be only a guess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This rule of simplicity may also be expressed mathematically.
 The mathematical relations encountered in physics may often be represented
 by power series such as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $y=A+Bx+Cx^{2}+Dx^{3}+Ex^{4}+...$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where A, B, C, ...
 are constants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For very "wiggly" curves, many terms of this equation, including high powers
 of x, might be required to express the equation of the relation.
 The simplest relations are those which contain the smallest powers of x.
 The simplest relations of all are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
y = a or y = a + bx
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which describe straight lines.
 Many relations in physics are, fortunately, of this form.
 Others only include the x2 term, describing a parabolic curve.
 Note that double valued curves, sometimes encountered in physics, cannot
 be represented by Equation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When sizable amounts of data are taken, standard mathematical methods are
 available which generate the equation of the simplest curve which statistically
 "best fits" the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The student may wonder how one can be certain that the curve fitted to the
 data is the "correct" curve.
 The answer is that relations are never known with certainty.
 The uncertainty of available data always limits the certainty of the results.
 Someday someone may obtain more accurate data and be able to show that
 the old relations are slightly incorrect, and provide us with better ones.
 As data improves, so does our understanding of relations—this is the way
 of scientific progress.
 But we never should claim to know a relation better than the data allows.

Uncertainty in a Slope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One use of a computational graph is to determine the slope of a straight
 line.
 This is illustrated in Figure.
 Eight data points are shown with error bars on each.
 If these bars represent maximum error, any line drawn to represent this
 data should pass within all bars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the error bars represent error estimates smaller than the maximum (average
 deviation, standard deviation, etc.), then the fitted curve need not pass
 within all of the error bars, just most of them.

The dotted lines A and C fall within the error bars, and represent the maximum
 and minimum slope one could justify from this data.

 appear to be "suspect." But one ought not to "throw it out" without better
 reason, based on further investigation.

Graphs can be a valuable tool for determining or verifying functional relations
 between variables.
 Many special types of graph paper are available for handling the most frequentl
y encountered relations.
 You are probably already familiar with linear graph paper and polar coordinate
 paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may have purchased a packet of graph paper for this course.
 It includes samples of graph papers you will use in this course, and a
 few other types.
 As you read the material below, examine the corresponding papers from your
 packet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LINEAR RELATIONS are those which satisfy the equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
y = mx + b
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the variables are x and y, and m and b are constants.
 When y is plotted against x on ordinary Cartesian (linear) graph paper,
 the points fall on a straight line with slope m and a y-intercept b, as
 shown in Fig.
 1.5.
\end_layout

The slope of an experimental relation is often physically significant.
 It is obtained by choosing two well-separated points on the line (x

The slope of a straight line is a ratio of the "lengths" of two legs of
 a right triangle constructed with the legs parallel to the graph axes and
 with the graph line along the hypotenuse.
 Figure.
 illustrates this, the slope being Δy/Δx.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far this discussion has been strictly mathematical.
 Now let's consider a fairly realistic physical example.
 Figure.
 shows the curve from measurements of the velocity of a moving body as a
 function of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we use letters v for velocity and t for time, we'd expect this curve
 to be described by the relation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 + at
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here the constant a (acceleration) is the slope of the line, while vo plays
 the role of b in Equation.
 These two constants are physically significant, and we wish to find their
 values from the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We choose two points on the line at t = 4.25 and 8.75, with corresponding
 values of velocity: 42 cm/s and 98 cm/s.
 Mark these points on Figure.
 , to confirm these values.
 The slope of the line is therefore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $a=\dfrac{(98cm/s-42cm/s)}{8.75s-4.25s}=\dfrac{56}{4.5}\;cm/s^{2}=56/4.5\;cm/s^{2}=12.44cm/s^{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When calculating this ratio do not use ruler-measured lengths.
 The lengths are expressed in the units marked on the graph axes.
 The calculated slope is therefore independent of the particular choice
 of units, of the way you choose to label the graph scale divisions, and
 is also independent of the size of the graph paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
INTERCEPTS: The values of the intercepts are often physically significant.
 They can be simply read from the graph—if the 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset

 axes happen to be within the graph's boundaries.
 In the equation y = mx + b, the y intercept is b.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The v intercept of Figure.
 is the value of v when t = 0.
 It has the same units and dimensions as y.
 If, as in this case, the v intercept does not lie within the area of the
 graph, it may be calculated using the slope and one value taken from a
 point on the fitted line.
 Take the point v = 98 cm/s when t = 8.75 sec.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 + at , in our case, v = v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
so,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 - 12.44 t = 98 - 12.44(8.75) = -10.89 cm/s A check of the graph, Figure.
 , shows that this looks reasonable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
STRAIGHTENING A CURVE.
 When it is possible to convert an experimental relation to a straight line
 graph it is usually useful to do so.
 Look for such opportunities.
 For example, when studying gases at constant temperature we find that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PV = C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where P is pressure, V is the gas volume and C is constant.
 The graph of P vs.
 V is a branch of an hyperbola.
 But if we graph P vs.
 1/V, or V vs.
 1/P, the data would fall on a straight line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $P=\left(\dfrac{1}{V}\right)C$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One reason for doing this is that it is easier to fit the experimental data
 with a ruler-drawn straight line, than to draw the best hyperbola on a
 PV graph.
 Another advantage is that the P vs.
 1/V graph has a slope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $C=\dfrac{\triangle P}{\triangle\left(\dfrac{1}{V}\right)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore the constant C is easily determined from the straight line.
 This constant was not evident, nor was it easy to determine from the PV
 graph!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inexpensive electronic calculators make it so easy to manipulate data that
 there is no good excuse to pass up an opportunity to "linearize" experimental
 graphs.

Common Graph Forms in Physics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Working with graphs – interpreting, creating, and employing – is an essential
 skill in the sciences, and especially in physics where relationships need
 to be derived.
 As an introductory physics student you should be familiar with the typical
 forms of graphs that appear in physics.
 Below are a number of typical physical relationships exhibited graphically
 using standard X-Y coordinates (e.g., no logarithmic, power, trigonometric,
 or inverse plots, etc.).
 Study the forms of the graphs carefully, and be prepared to use the program
 Graphical Analysis to formulate relationships between variables by using
 appropriate curve-fitting strategies.
 Note that all non-linear forms of graphs can be made to appear linear by
 “linearizing” the data.
 Linearization consists of such things as plotting X versus Y

This might be a graph of the pressure and temperature for a changing volume
 constant temperature gas.
 How would you find this relationship short of using a computer package?
 The answer is to simplify the plot by manipulating the data.
 Plot the Y variable versus the inverse of the X variable.
 The graph becomes a straight line.
 The resulting formula will be Y = A/X or XY = A.

In the latter two examples above there are only subtle differences in form.
 Many common graph forms in physics appear quite similar.
 Only by looking at the “RMSE” (root mean square error provided in Graphical
 Analysis) can one conclude whether one fit is better than another.
 The better fit is the one with the smaller RMSE.

For a distance-time graph, the distance never decreases.
 When the object is stationary, the distance-time graph will be horizontal.
 The gradient of a distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed of the
 object.
 For straight line with positive gradient, it means that the object is travellin

 the distance never decreases) For curves, it means that the object is travellin

\begin_layout Standard
Since you are not allowed to use calculators, SAT II Physics places a heavy
 emphasis on qualitative problems.
 A common way of testing kinematics qualitatively is to present you with
 a graph plotting position vs.
 time, velocity vs.
 time, or acceleration vs.
 time and to ask you questions about the motion of the object represented
 by the graph.
 Because SAT II Physics is entirely made up of multiple-choice questions,
 you won’t need to know how to draw graphs; you’ll just have to interpret
 the data presented in them.
 Knowing how to read such graphs quickly and accurately will not only help
 you solve problems of this sort, it will also help you visualize the often-abst
ract realm of kinematic equations.
 In the examples that follow, we will examine the movement of an ant running
 back and forth along a line.

Position vs.
 time graphs give you an easy and obvious way of determining an object’s
 displacement at any given time, and a subtler way of determining that object’s
 velocity at any given time.
 Let’s put these concepts into practice by looking at the following graph
 charting the movements of our friendly ant.

\begin_layout Standard
Any point on this graph gives us the position of the ant at a particular
 moment in time.
 For instance, the point at (2,–2) tells us that, two seconds after it started
 moving, the ant was two centimeters to the left of its starting position,
 and the point at (3,1) tells us that, three seconds after it started moving,
 the ant is one centimeter to the right of its starting position.
 Let’s read what the graph can tell us about the ant’s movements.
 For the first two seconds, the ant is moving to the left.
 Then, in the next second, it reverses its direction and moves quickly to
 y = 1.
 The ant then stays still at y = 1 for three seconds before it turns left
 again and moves back to where it started.
 Note how concisely the graph displays all this information.
 Calculating Velocity We know the ant’s displacement, and we know how long
 it takes to move from place to place.
 Armed with this information, we should also be able to determine the ant’s
 velocity, since velocity measures the rate of change of displacement over
 time.
 If displacement is given here by the vector y, then the velocity of the
 ant is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $v=\dfrac{\triangle y}{\triangle t}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you recall, the slope of a graph is a measure of rise over run; that
 is, the amount of change in the y direction divided by the amount of change
 in the x direction.
 In our graph, is the change in the y direction and is the change in the
 x direction, so v is a measure of the slope of the graph.
 For any position vs.
 time graph, the velocity at time t is equal to the slope of the line at
 t.
 In a graph made up of straight lines, like the one above, we can easily
 calculate the slope at each point on the graph, and hence know the instantaneou
s velocity at any given time.
 We can tell that the ant has a velocity of zero from t = 3 to t = 6, because
 the slope of the line at these points is zero.
 We can also tell that the ant is cruising along at the fastest speed between
 t = 2 and t = 3, because the position vs.
 time graph is steepest between these points.
 Calculating the ant’s average velocity during this time interval is a simple
 matter of dividing rise by run, as we’ve learned in math class.

How about the average velocity between t = 0 and t = 3? It’s actually easier
 to sort this out with a graph in front of us, because it’s easy to see
 the displacement at t = 0 and t = 3, and so that we don’t confuse displacement
 and distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Average Speed 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the total displacement in the first three seconds is one centimeter
 to the right, the total distance traveled is two centimeters to the left,
 and then three centimeters to the right, for a grand total of five centimeters.
 Thus, the average speed is not the same as the average velocity of the
 ant.
 Once we’ve calculated the total distance traveled by the ant, though, calculati
ng its average speed is not difficult:

Curved Position vs.
 Time Graphs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is all well and good, but how do you calculate the velocity of a curved
 position vs.
 time graph? Well, the bad news is that you’d need calculus.
 The good news is that SAT II Physics doesn’t expect you to use calculus,
 so if you are given a curved position vs.
 time graph, you will only be asked qualitative questions and won’t be expected
 to make any calculations.
 A few points on the graph will probably be labeled, and you will have to
 identify which point has the greatest or least velocity.
 Remember, the point with the greatest slope has the greatest velocity,
 and the point with the least slope has the least velocity.
 The turning points of the graph, the tops of the “hills” and the bottoms
 of the “valleys” where the slope is zero, have zero velocity.

\begin_layout Standard
In this graph, for example, the velocity is zero at points A and C, greatest
 at point D, and smallest at point B.
 The velocity at point B is smallest because the slope at that point is
 negative.
 Because velocity is a vector quantity, the velocity at B would be a large
 negative number.
 However, the speed at B is greater even than the speed at D: speed is a
 scalar quantity, and so it is always positive.
 The slope at B is even steeper than at D, so the speed is greatest at B.
 Velocity vs.
 Time Graphs Velocity vs.
 time graphs are the most eloquent kind of graph we’ll be looking at here.
 They tell us very directly what the velocity of an object is at any given
 time, and they provide subtle means for determining both the position and
 acceleration of the same object over time.
 The “object” whose velocity is graphed below is our ever-industrious ant,
 a little later in the day.

We can learn two things about the ant’s velocity by a quick glance at the
 graph.
 First, we can tell exactly how fast it is going at any given time.
 For instance, we can see that, two seconds after it started to move, the
 ant is moving at 2 cm/s.
 Second, we can tell in which direction the ant is moving.
 From t = 0 to t = 4, the velocity is positive, meaning that the ant is
 moving to the right.
 From t = 4 to t = 7, the velocity is negative, meaning that the ant is
 moving to the left.
 Calculating Acceleration We can calculate acceleration on a velocity vs.
 time graph in the same way that we calculate velocity on a position vs.
 time graph.
 Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity vector, , which expresses
 itself as the slope of the velocity vs.
 time graph.
 For a velocity vs.
 time graph, the acceleration at time t is equal to the slope of the line
 at t.
 What is the acceleration of our ant at t = 2.5 and t = 4? Looking quickly
 at the graph, we see that the slope of the line at t = 2.5 is zero and hence
 the acceleration is likewise zero.
 The slope of the graph between t = 3 and t = 5 is constant, so we can calculate
 the acceleration at t = 4 by calculating the average acceleration between
 t = 3 and t = 5:

\begin_layout Standard
The minus sign tells us that acceleration is in the leftward direction,
 since we’ve defined the y-coordinates in such a way that right is positive
 and left is negative.
 At t = 3, the ant is moving to the right at 2 cm/s, so a leftward acceleration
 means that the ant begins to slow down.
 Looking at the graph, we can see that the ant comes to a stop at t = 4,
 and then begins accelerating to the right.

\begin_layout Subsection
Calculating Displacement 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Velocity vs.
 time graphs can also tell us about an object’s displacement.
 Because velocity is a measure of displacement over time, we can infer that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
displacement = velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphically, this means that the displacement in a given time interval is
 equal to the area under the graph during that same time interval.
 If the graph is above the t-axis, then the positive displacement is the
 area between the graph and the t-axis.
 If the graph is below the t-axis, then the displacement is negative, and
 is the area between the graph and the t-axis.
 Let’s look at two examples to make this rule clearer.
 First, what is the ant’s displacement between t = 2 and t = 3? Because
 the velocity is constant during this time interval, the area between the
 graph and the t-axis is a rectangle of width 1 and height 2.

The area of the shaded region, and consequently the change in velocity during
 this time interval, is 1 cm/s2 · 3 s = 3 cm/s to the right.
 This doesn’t mean that the velocity at t = 5 is 3 cm/s; it simply means
 that the velocity is 3 cm/s greater than it was at t = 2.
 Since we have not been given the velocity at t = 2, we can’t immediately
 say what the velocity is at t = 5.
 Summary of Rules for Reading Graphs You may have trouble recalling when
 to look for the slope and when to look for the area under the graph.
 Here are a couple handy rules of thumb: The slope on a given graph is equivalen
t to the quantity we get by dividing the y-axis by the x-axis.
 For instance, the y-axis of a position vs.
 time graph gives us displacement, and the x-axis gives us time.
 Displacement divided by time gives us velocity, which is what the slope
 of a position vs.
 time graph represents.
 The area under a given graph is equivalent to the quantity we get by multiplyin
g the x-axis and the y-axis.
 For instance, the y-axis of an acceleration vs.
 time graph gives us acceleration, and the x-axis gives us time.
 Acceleration multiplied by time gives us the change in velocity, which
 is what the area between the graph and the x-axis represents.
 We can summarize what we know about graphs in a table:

1.
 Which object(s) is(are) maintaining a state of motion (i.e., maintaining
 a constant velocity)? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer ; Objects A, B, D, and E.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects A, B, D, and E are maintaining a state of motion (i.e., remaining
 with constant velocity) as demonstrated by the constant slope.
 If the slope is constant, then the velocity is constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Which object(s) is(are) accelerating? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object C is accelerating.
 An accelerating object has a changing velocity.
 Since the slope of a p-t graph equals the velocity, an accelerating object
 is represented by a changing slope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Which object(s) is(are) not moving? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Objects A and E.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects A and E are not moving.
 An object which is not moving has a zero velocity; this translates into
 a line with zero slope on a p-t graph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Which object(s) change(s) its direction? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : None of the objects change direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of these objects change direction.
 An object changes its direction if it changes from a + to a - velocity
 (or vice versa).
 This translates into a p-t graph with a + slope and then a - slope (or
 vice versa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 On average, which object is traveling fastest? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object B is traveling fastest.
 To be traveling fastest is to have the greatest speed (or greatest magnitude
 of velocity).
 This translates into the line on a p-t graph with the greatest slope.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 On average, which moving object is traveling slowest? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object D.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object D is traveling slowest.
 To be traveling slowest is to have the smallest speed (or smallest magnitude
 of velocity).
 This translates into the line on a p-t graph with the smallest slope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Which object has the greatest acceleration? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer ; Object C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object C has the greatest acceleration.
 It is the only object with an acceleration.
 Accelerated motion on a p-t graph is represented by a curved line.

8.
 Which object(s) is(are) maintaining its state of motion? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Objects A and E.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects A and E are maintaining their state of motion.
 To maintain the state of motion is to keep a constant velocity (i.e., to
 have a zero acceleration).
 This translates into a zero slope on a v-t graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
9.
 Which object(s) is(are) accelerating? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Objects B and C (and D during the first part of its motion).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects B and C are accelerating (and for a while, object D).
 Accelerated motion is indicated by a sloped line on a v-t graph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
10.
 Which object(s) is(are) not moving? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Each of the objects are moving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the objects are moving.
 If an object were not moving, then the v-t graph would be a horizontal
 line along the axis (v = 0 m/s).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
11.
 Which object(s) change(s) its direction? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Objects B and C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects B and C change their direction.
 An object that is changing its direction is changing from a + to a - velocity.
 Thus, the line on a v-t graph will pass from the + to the - region of the
 graph.
 Object D is not changing its direction; object D first moves in the - direction
 with increasing speed and then maintains a constant speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
12.
 Which accelerating object has the smallest acceleration? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object B has the smallest acceleration.
 Acceleration is indicated by the slope of the line.
 The object with the smallest acceleration is the object with the smallest
 slope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
13.
 Which object has the greatest velocity? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object A (E is a close second place).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object A has the greatest velocity (and object E is a "close second").
 The velocity is indicated by how far above or how far below the axis the
 line is.
 Object A has a large + velocity.
 Object E has a large (but not as large) - velocity.

 Sketch a velocity-time graph for an object moving with a constant speed
 in the positive direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object moving with a constant speed
 in the positive direction is shown below.
 To have "a constant speed in the positive direction" is to have a + velocity
 which is unchanging.
 Thus, the line on the graph will be in the + region of the graph (above
 0).
 Since the velocity is unchanging, the line is horizontal.
 Since the slope of a line on a v-t graph is the object's acceleration,
 a horizontal line (zero slope) on a v-t graph is characteristic of a motion
 with zeo acceleration (constant velocity).

 To have "a constant speed in the negative direction" is to have a - velocity

 Since the velocity is unchanging, the line is horizontal.
 Since the slope of a line on a v-t graph is the object's acceleration,

 Sketch a velocity-time graph for an object moving in the + direction, accelerat

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object moving in the + direction,
 accelerating from a slow speed to a fast speed is shown below.
 An object which is moving in the + direction and speeding up (slow to fast)
 has a + acceleration.
 (If necessary, review the dir'n of the acceleration vector in the Physics
 Classroom Tutorial.) Since the slope of a line on a v-t graph is the object's
 acceleration, an object with + acceleration is represented by a line with
 + slope.
 Thus, the line is a straight diagonal line with upward (+) slope.
 Since the velocity is +, the line is plotted in the + region of the v-t
 graph.

Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object moving in the + direction,
 accelerating from a fast speed to a slow speed is shown below.
 An object whgich is moving in the + direction and slowing down (fast to

Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object which first moves with a slow,
 constant speed in the + direction, and then with a fast constant speed
 in the + direction is shown below.
 Since there are two parts of this object's motion, there will be two distinct
 parts on the graph.
 Each part is in the + region of the v-t graph (above 0) since the velocity
 is +.
 Each part is horizontal since the velocity during each part is constant
 (constant velocity means zero acceleration which means zero slope).
 The second part of the graph will be higher since the velocity is greater
 during the second part of the motion.

First car's (red) distance at time t is found by finding the area of the
 trapezoid whose boundary is the t-axis, the red lines and the vertical
 line representing time at t seconds.
 This of course assumes t>15 (otherwise, we have negative distances, and
 the trapezoid only starts at t=15.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the distance (at time t)
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle =\frac{1}{2}\times13.5\left(t+t-15\right)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
= The distance of the second car (blue) is found by finding the area of
 the blue trapezoid, bounded by the blue lines, the t-axis and the vertical
 line.
 (And this one assumes t>20, for the same reasons as above.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the distance (at time t)
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle =\frac{1}{2}\times17\left(t+t-20\right)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distance when they meet is the same, so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\times13.5\times\left(2t-15\right)}$
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\times17\times\left(2t-20\right)$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time =19.643 s 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distance=163.93 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dilemma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this solution gives us a dilemma.
 As mentioned above, the expressions we found for the area of the trapezoids
 required t to be more than 15 s and 20 s, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can confirm the blue car overtakes the red car before 20 seconds, by
 calculating the distances travelled at that time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After 20 seconds:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Red car has travelled 0.5×(20+5)×13.5=168.75 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blue car has travelled 0.5×20×17=170 m The blue car has travelled further
 than the red car, so it means it has already overtaken the red car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back to the drawing board
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, in fact, for this question we need to consider the area of the blue
 triangle, not the blue trapezoid.
\end_layout

This is the correct diagram for finding t:

The red car's distance is fine from before (it's a trapezoid):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle d=\frac{1}{2}\times13.5\left(t+t-15\right)}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $distance{\displaystyle =\frac{1}{2}\times t\times0.85\times t}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equating these gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.75(2t − 15) = 0.425t
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
t =12.14 s, t = 19.63 s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first solution has no practical meaning, since t>15 for the expression
 to work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we conclude the time taken for the blue car to overtake the red car is
 19.63 s and the distance travelled at that time is 163.7 m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate we have found the correct answer, below is the graph of distance
 against time.
 Labelling of axes is very important in this work!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The red curve corresponds to the acceleration portion of the first race
 car.
 At t=15, or point C(15,101.25), the red car stops accelerating and continues
 at a constant speed (CA is no longer a curve, but a straight line).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blue curve corresponds to the second (blue) car.
 It doesn't accelerate as hard (its curve is below the red curve, indicating
 it covers less distance in the same time), but it accelerates for longer.
 At t=20, or point D (20,170), it stops accelerating and its graph is now
 a straight line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can see the curves intersect at time t=19.63 s, or point A (19.63,163.7),
 as we found in the calculation above.
 This means they have covered the same distance (163.7 m) at that time, so
 that's when the blue car passes the red car.

Solution
\end_layout

\end_inset

 : (Hint : In this problem, you are asked to describe the motion of the
 car.
 Whenever you are asked to describe the motion of an object without worrying
 about the cause of that motion, you have a kinematics problem.
 This problem is different from most kinematics problems, however, in that
 you are not asked for a numerical description but rather to use words and
 graphs to describe how the car moves.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Queries : How did you know that x = 0 at t = 0? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You don’t! If you are given a velocity-time graph, you know the initial
 speed but not the initial location of the object.
 (Calculus students, remember v = dx/dt, and the derivative of a constant—your
 initial location—is zero.) I chose to call the location of the car at t
 = 0 the origin, but you could start your graph at any point.
 The shape of the graph, however, should look the same.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why can’t I treat the straight line from t1 to t3 in a single step? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any time velocity is above the t-axis, it has a positive value and so slope
 of the x-t graph is also positive.
 A positive slope means that the line or curve is in such a direction as
 to make between a 0 and a 900 angle above the +x axis.
 Any time velocity is below the t-axis, it has a negative value and so the
 slope of the x-t graph is also negative.
 A negative slope means that the line or curve is in such a direction as
 to make between a 0 and a 900 angle below the +x axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why doesn’t the line from t3 to t4 look more curved? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the velocity-time curve gets closer and closer to v = 0 (the t-axis),
 velocity’s value is getting smaller regardless of direction.
 As the value of v decreases, so does the slope of the x-t graph.
 A decreasing slope means that the slope gets smaller and smaller—the line
 gets becomes more horizontal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curve from t3 to t4 on the x-t graph shown here doesn’t look very curved.
 This is because its slope goes from the same value as it ended with on
 the t2 to t3 curve to almost zero (a horizontal line) and so not a lot
 of change as I have drawn it.
 Any line you draw that curves down and to the right becoming more horizontal
 as it goes is fine.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Select a relation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To go between a velocity-time graph and a displacement-time or acceleration-time
 graph, you need to understand how velocity, displacement and acceleration
 are related to each other.
 In other words, you need to use the definitions of velocity and acceleration:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = Δx/Δt In words, the value of velocity = the slope of the x-t graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a = Δv/Δt In words, the value of acceleration = the slope of the v-t graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: Graphing problems seem like they should be straightforward, and the
 equations that you need are only those given above.
 It is very, very common, however, to make mistakes on these problems because
 it feels like the graphs should be pictures of the motion and they are
 not.
 In order to avoid those mistakes, make a table based on the sentences above
 and then draw the graph from the table.

Understand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this problem, you are given the velocity-time graph for the motion of
 a car.
 By relating the value of velocity to the slope of the x-t graph (this is
 just the definition of velocity) you are able to draw the x-t graph correspondi
ng to this motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By relating the slope of the v-t graph to the value of acceleration (this
 is just the definition of acceleration) you are able to draw the a-t graph
 corresponding to this motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can describe the motion looking at any of the three graphs.
 From t = 0 to t1 : The car travels forward (+ direction) with a constant
 speed.
 There is no acceleration and the car moves away from its starting point
 at a constant rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From t1 to t2 : The car slows to a stop at a constant rate.
 It is still moving forward, but the amount of distance it covers in each
 second is decreasing.
 Acceleration acts against the motion of the car, or in the negative direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From t2 to t3 : The car reverses direction, moving faster and faster (at
 a constant acceleration) in the negative direction.
 Acceleration is acting with the motion of the car, so it is also in the
 negative direction.
 The amount of distance the car covers each second increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From t3 to t4 : The car continues to move in the negative direction but
 at a decreasing speed.
 The rate at which the speed decreases is getting greater—the driver is
 braking harder as the car stops—and so acceleration increases.
 Acceleration is acting against the motion of the car, or in the positive
 direction.
 The car covers less and less distance each second.

Solution
\end_layout

\end_inset

 : a.) The total distance traveled by the object is the sum of all the distances
 it traveled during the time interval.
 In the first two seconds it traveled 3 m.
 Then it traveled 0 m in the next two seconds.
 Then over the next five seconds, the object moved 5 m, then remained at
 rest.
 so the total distance is 3 + 5 = 8 m.
 The displacement of the object is simply the final position minus the initial
 position, or -2 - 0 = -2 m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.) Notice that each of these points is in the middle of a line segment on
 the graph.
 Because of this, the instantaneous velocity at these points is the same
 as the average velocity over the time intervals represented by each segment,
 so: v(t) = (xf - xi)/(tf - ti) v(1) = (3 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 3/2 = 1.5 m/s v(3)
 = (3 - 3)/(4 - 2) = 0/2 = 0 m/s v(6) = (-2 - 3)/(9 - 4) = -5/5 = -1 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the formula (xf - xi)/(tf - ti) is the same as the slope formula
 for this graph.
 The velocity at any point on a position vs.
 time graph is simply the slope of the graph at that point.
 By this definition, we also know that the velocity of any position function
 is its derivative with respect to time.
 You can also go from a velocity function to a position function using integrati
on.
 Go to calculus notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.) Average velocity is displacement divided by time.
 We found in part a that the object's displacement is -2 m, so: vavg = -2/10
 = -0.2 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Average speed is total distance divided be time, and we found in part a
 that the object's total distance traveled is 8 m.
 so: 8/10 = 0.8 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d.) We determined in part b that the object's velocity is represented by
 the slope of the line segment on the graph.
 Since the slope of this segment is constant, the object's velocity at t
 = 5 is constant.
 Since constant velocity means there is no acceleration, a = 0.

\end_inset

 : a.) Recall that the equation for velocity is v = x/t.
 If we solve this for x, we get x = vt.
 Notice that this is the same as the area of a rectangles whose sides are
 lengths v and t, so we can determine that the displacement is the area
 enclosed by the velocity vs.
 time graph.
 So, we will find the area of each section under the graph:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total distance traveled by the object is simply the sum of all these
 areas: 3 + 6 + 4.5 + 2 + 2 = 17.5 m The displacement is found in a similar
 fashion, except areas below the x-axis are considered negative: 3 + 6 +
 4.5 - 2 - 2 = 9.5 m Interestingly enough, the area enclosed by any function
 can be represented by a definite integral.
 For example, if this graph were defined as a function v(t), then the displaceme
nt would be the integral from 0 to 10 of v(t)dt, and the total distance
 traveled would be the integral from 0 to 10 of |v(t)|dt Go to calculus
 notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.) The position of the object at a given point in time can be found in much
 the same way we found the displacement in part a, except this time we must
 also add in the initial value given.
 So: x(2) = 2 + 3 = 5 m x(4) = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 m x(7) = 2 + 3 + 6 + 4.5 =
 15.5 m x(10) = 2 + 3 + 6 + 4.5 - 2 - 2 = 11.5 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that this can also be done by adding the integral from 0 to t of
 v(t)dt to the initial value of 2.
 Go to calculus notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.) Like velocity in part b of problem 22, the instantaneous acceleration
 at any point along one of the graph's line segments is the same as the
 average acceleration across that line segment.
 The formula for acceleration is aavg = Δv/Δt = (vf - vi)/(tf - ti), so:
 a(t) = (vf - vi)/(tf - ti) a(1) = (3 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 3/2 = 1.5 m/s2 a(3)
 = (3 - 3)/(4 - 2) = 0/2 = 0 m/s2 a(6) = (-2 - 3)/(9 - 4) = -5/5 = -1 m/s2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to the relationship between velocity and position, the formula
 for acceleration is the same as the slope formula for a velocity vs.
 time graph.
 So, we can say that the slope of any velocity vs.
 time graph is its acceleration.
 Notice that this definition defines acceleration as the derivative of velocity.
 So, it is true that for any velocity function v(t), its derivative is an
 acceleration function a(t).
 Also, integration can be used to go from an acceleration function to a
 position function.
 Go to calculus notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d.) We know that the acceleration along each line segment of this velocity
 vs.
 time graph is equal to the slope of the line segment.
 We determined these slopes in part c, so the acceleration graph would look

 highest and lowest slope:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the red tangent lines, we can immediately eliminate point B as
 a candidate for both the maximum and minimum velocity, as its tangent is
 horizontal and thus has a slope of 0.
 Point C is the only marked point whose tangent line has a negative slope,
 so point C has the lowest velocity.
 Looking at points A and D, point A's tangent line has a steeper positive
 slope so point A has the highest velocity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.) We know that acceleration is a change in velocity, so by asking whether
 acceleration is positive or negative, we are asking if the velocity is
 increasing or decreasing.
 Since velocity is the slope of this graph, we must determine how the slope
 of the curve is changing between points A and B.
 Looking at the diagram in part a, we see that the slope at point A is positive,
 and the slope at point B is 0.
 As such, the slope, and thus the velocity, must be decreasing.
 Therefore, the object's acceleration is negative in this interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.) We know from problem 22 that velocity is the derivative of position,
 and from problem 23 that acceleration is the derivative of velocity.
 So, we will begin by differentiating the position function twice: x(t)
 = t3 - 9.5t2 + 23t - 9 v(t) = 3t2 - 19t + 23 a(t) = 6t - 19
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we know the velocity and acceleration functions, all that is left
 is to plug the values of t into these functions and simplify: v(1) = 3
 * 12 - 19 * 1 + 23 = 3 - 19 + 23 = 7 m/s v(3) = 3 * 32 - 19 * 3 + 23 =
 27 - 57 + 23 = -7 m/s v(5) = 3 * 52 - 19 * 5 + 23 = 75 - 95 + 23 = 3 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a(1) = 6 * 1 - 19 = 6 - 19 = -13 m/s2 a(3) = 6 * 3 - 19 = 18 - 19 = -1 m/s2
 a(5) = 6 * 5 - 19 = 30 - 19 = 11 m/s2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d.) Thinking logically about the graph, the possible candidates for maximum
 and minimum position are at the end points of the interval and at the spots,
 like point B, where the slope of the graph is 0.
 So, first we set the velocity function from part c equal to 0 and solve
 for t: v(t) = 3t2 - 19t + 23 = 0 t = 1.63008 s or t = 4.70326 s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this was solved using a graphing calculator.
 The AP exam will not ask you to solve a quadratic this complicated by hand,
 however you may have to solve a simpler function using the quadratic formula.
 Also, we keep as many decimal places as we can at this stage in order to
 maintain accuracy.
 Now that we know all the possible times at which the position could be
 at a maximum or minimum within the interval, we simply plug these t values
 into x(t).
 Don't forget to check the end points: x(t) = t3 - 9.5t2 + 23t - 9 x(1) =
 5.5 m x(1.63008) = 7.58 m x(4.70326) = -6.93 m x(6) = 3 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that the minimum position is -6.93 m, and the maximum position is
 7.58 m.
 Finding the maximum and minimum velocities is achieved in the same manner,
 except we set the acceleration function equal to 0 and plug the t values
 into the velocity funtion: a(t) = 6t - 19 = 0 6t = 19 t = 19/6 = 3.16667
 s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v(t) = 3t2 - 19t + 23 v(1) = 7 m/s v(3.16667) = -7.08 m/s v(6) = 17 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the minimum velocity is -7.08 m/s, and the maximum velocity is 17 m/s.

 No explicit use of the standard kinematic equations is made; the solution

 His initial velocity is zero.
 The rocketeer arrives at the roof of the building 5 seconds later to save
 the student.
 The rocketeer leaves the roof with an initial velocity downward and then
 is in freefall.
 in order both to catch the student and to prevent injury to him, the rocketeer
 should catch the student at a sufficiently great height and arrive at the
 ground with zero velocity.
 The upward acceleration that accomplishes this is provided by the rocketeer’s
 jet pack, which he turns on just as he catches the student; before then
 the student is in freefall.
 To prevent discomfort to the student, the magnitude of the acceleration
 is limited to five times gravity.

\end_inset

 : As I was grading the assignment, one student’s solution stuck out.
 When I first saw it, I was convinced that something must be wrong as the
 problem had been difficult for me and could not be that simple.
 I was wrong.
 The simple solution consists of sketching the velocity and acceleration
 graphs for the falling student (Fig.
 2; down is taken as the positive direction) and using a bit of reasoning.
 Since the overall change in the student’s velocity during his motion is
 zero, the total area under the acceleration-versus-time graph must equal
 zero.
 This area consists of a positive part (above the time axis) and a negative
 part (below the time axis).
 The two rectangular areas must have equal magnitude, and since their heights
 differ by a factor of 5, so must their widths (the two corresponding times).
 Therefore, the freefall time is five times longer than the time for slow-down
 to rest.
 Now, looking at the velocity graph, the area labeled 1 corresponds to the
 displacement while in freefall, and the area labeled 2 represents the displacem
ent after the Rocketeer has caught the student.
 The triangles forming areas 1 and 2 have the same height, and the base
 (time) for area 1 is five times the base (time) for area 2.
 Therefore, area 1 must be five times larger than area 2.
 This means that area 2 must be 1/6 the total height of the building, or
 92.2 m.

After studying this solution for a long time and finding no flaws in the
 physics, I pulled out my physics book and tried solving other one-dimensional
 kinematics problems in a similar manner.
 It quickly became obvious that they could be done using graphs, and in
 most cases this is the easier method.
 I was hooked and began teaching one-dimensional problem solving this way
 in all my classes.
 The next class period I asked the student whose solution this was why he
 chose to do the problem this way.
 He explained that we had emphasized graphs so much in class that they must
 be more useful than something we are simply supposed to sketch for the
 problems.
 I was amazed and appreciative as I now had a new way to teach problem solving.
 This kind of solution is more visual and helps get students away from hunting
 for the “correct equation.” It has worked well for me at all levels of introduct
ory physics, conceptual through calculus based.
 If you find other interesting problems that are especially suited to the
 above method, I would appreciate your sharing them.

{ Hint: The displacement in a velocity-time graph is given by the area under
 the graph with proper signs.
 From 0s - to 2s , the area is 8m .
 From 2s - to 4s , the area is -4m .
 From 4s - to 8s , the area is 8m.
 Adding these 3 values , we get 8m + (-4m) + 8m = 12m.

d) As the Graph A has a constant slope, so the acceleration of body A is
 zero.
 Whereas Graph B is constantly turning, so the slope can be assumed to be
 non-zero throughout.
 According to some revelations, however it is noted that the figure is not
 clear enough to show whether Graph B is straight after

 In case it is assumed to be straight, then after

 both trains will have same (zero) acceleration.

 ratio of the two large ( infinite ) values may be calculated if initial

Change in Momentum or the "Impulse" 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The change in the momentum of a system (or the impulse delivered by the
 net force) is given mathematically by the Momentum Principle, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\overrightarrow{p}=\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\triangle t$
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pa.msu.edu"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this form, the change in momentum is calculated over a “discrete” time
 step.
 That is, the calculation is done over a known or determined time interval.
 If the force is non-constant (i.e., depends on location or velocity), this
 calculation is not exact.
 In fact, in this case, the net force is the average net force over the
 time interval.
 So that a better definition is this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\overrightarrow{p}=\overrightarrow{F_{net,avg}}\triangle t$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This definition works well for case where you might use iterative procedures
 to determine the change in momentum over small time intervals.
 If on the other hand, you can analytically integrate the force (e.g., it
 is or can be put into a form which is time dependent), then you can use
 the derivative form of the Momentum Principle,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $Δ\overrightarrow{p}=\intop_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}\overset{\rightarrow}{F}_{net}dt$

In any event, either (or both) can be useful to think about graphs of force
 vs time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Force vs Time Graphs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some situations, it is easier to empirically measure force versus time
 graphs because the situations lend themselves more easily to these empirical
 measurements rather than what might be more complex physical theories.
 This is true in different engineering contexts (e.g., impact design and the
 flow of fluids).
 In these cases, you are interested in determining the change in momentum
 (and thus the velocity) of the system in question1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below is a force vs time graph where the “area under the curve” has been
 highlighted.
 In this example, we are only looking at the component of the net force
 in the xx-direction.
 Such graphs can be produced for each component of the net force, but let's
 say that for this system, there was a non-zero component of the net force
 only in the x-direction.

For the above figure, the momentum change over the complete time interval
 can be determined in a straightforward way due to the simple geometric
 shapes produced.
 Area above the zero line are positive momentum changes, and area below
 are negative.
 By adding up the “area under the curve” in this way, we obtain a momentum
 change of 7 Ns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure below shows the force vs time graph for another system.
 In this case, the graph has a smooth form, which doesn't appear to be analytic.
 The “area under the curve” for this graph could be analyzed computationally,
 by taking small steps (i.e., Riemann Sum), and the change in momentum could
 be determined.

Question Modern cars are designed to crumple on impact in a collision.
 How does this help to protect the occupants from harm? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer The change in momentum (area under the force time graph) can't be
 changed at the time of the accident (mass is fixed and it is too late for
 the driver to slow down!) By increasing the time of collision the peak
 force is less and hopefully lets the occupants come to less harm as a result.

Solution
\end_layout

\end_inset

 : (Theory : So far we've implied some things about what is constant and
 what can change in the impulse formula F Δt = m Δv.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look at situations where we expect the mass of the object will stay constant.
 • The velocity will change, and that's why we put a delta in front of it.
 • Time is changing (sort of) as we measure it over a period of time.
 • Force must be a constant.
 We assume that the force being exerted on the object was always the same,
 causing a constant acceleration.
 If we are looking at a simple impulse question (where the force is constant),
 we can figure out exactly what we can interpret from a graph.
 • Later this may help us to figure out a more complicated question, like
 if the force changes.
 The following graph is an example of one of those simple situations where
 the force remains constant during the entire time.
 • If we look at what the slope might represent, we get...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
slope=rise / run 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
slope= F / 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle$
\end_inset

t ◦
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since nothing in the impulse formula can be rearranged to give us force
 over time, the slope doesn't mean anything to us in this situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we look at the area under the line, we get something a bit better...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Area=lw=F
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle$
\end_inset

t= 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle$
\end_inset

p )
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since area under the line is equal to impulse...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Area=lw 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Area=25
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

10 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Area=2.5e2 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p=2.5e2Ns 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we really wanted to, we could have simply use Δp = FΔt to figure out
 the impulse.
 We could do this in this situation because the force is constant.
 • If we need to do a question where the force is not constant, we can still
 use the area under the line to get the impulse, even though the formula
 Δp = FΔt can not be used.

 : Even though it is not a right angle triangle, this graph still shows
 a triangle that we can use the regular area formula with.
 In this case, we already know the area (the impulse is 500 kgm/s) and we
 know the base (10.0 s).
 All we want is the height of the triangle, since that is the magnitude
 of the maximum force.

Even if the graph is a curved line, you can still at least estimate the
 area under the graph.
 • Although this will only be an approximate area, without getting into
 calculus it's as good as you'll get and as good as you need.
 ◦ On the graph shown below we have an s-curve that would be difficult to
 calculate the exact area of.
 ◦ Instead, we just look at the triangle drawn in red.
 For the little bit extra it has near the beginning, it misses a bit later
 on.
 These two parts should more or less make up for each other, so that the
 area of the triangle will be about the same as the area under the curve.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EXPLORATION – An impulsive bike ride Suki is riding her bicycle, in a straight
 line, along a flat road.
 Suki and her bike have a combined mass of 50 kg.
 At t = 0, Suki is traveling at 8.0 m/s.
 Suki coasts for 10 seconds, but when she realizes she is slowing down,
 she pedals for the next 20 seconds.
 Suki pedals so that the static friction force exerted on the bike by the
 road increases linearly with time from 0 to 40 N, in the direction Suki
 is traveling, over that 20-second period.
 Assume there is constant 10 N resistive force, from air resistance and
 other factors, acting on her and the bicycle the entire time.
 Step 1 - Sketch a diagram of the situation.
 The diagram is shown in Figure 6.2, along with the free-body diagram that
 applies for the first 10 s and the free-body diagram that applies for the
 20second period while Suki is pedaling.

 Note that in free-body diagram (c), the static friction force 
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{\rightarrow}{F_{S}}$
\end_inset

 gradually increases because of the way Suki pedals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 2 - Sketch a graph of the net force acting on Suki and her bicycle
 as a function of time.
 Take the positive direction to be the direction Suki is traveling.
 In the vertical direction, the normal force exactly balances the force
 of gravity, so we can focus on the horizontal forces.
 For the first 10 seconds, we have only the 10 N resistive force, which
 acts to oppose the motion and is thus in the negative direction.
 For the next 20 seconds, we have to account for the friction force that
 acts in the direction of motion and the resistive force.
 We can account for their combined effect by drawing a straight line that
 goes from –10 N at t = 10 s, to +30 N (40 N – 10N) at t = 30 s.
 The result is shown in Figure 6.3.

\begin_layout Standard
Step 3 - What is Suki’s speed at t = 10 s? Let’s apply Equation 6.3, which
 we can write as: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{\rightarrow}{F_{net}}\text{∆}t=\text{∆}(m\overset{\rightarrow}{v})=m\text{∆}\overrightarrow{v}=m(\overrightarrow{v_{10s}}-\overrightarrow{v_{i}})$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving for the velocity at t = 10 s gives: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{v_{10s}}=\overrightarrow{v_{i}}+\dfrac{\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\triangle t}{m}=+8.0m/s+\dfrac{(-10N)(10s)}{50kg}=+8.0m/s-2.0m/s=+6.0m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, Suki’s speed at t = 10 s is 6.0 m/s.
 We can also obtain this result from the forceversus-time graph, by recognizing
 that the impulse, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\text{∆}t$
\end_inset

 , represents the area under this graph over some time interval ∆t .
 Let’s find the area under the graph, over the first 10 seconds, shown highlight
ed in green in Figure 6.4.
 The area is negative, because the net force is negative over that time
 interval.
 The area under the graph is the impulse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\text{∆}t=-10N\times10s=-100Ns=-100kg\;m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 6.4: The green rectangle represents the area under the graph for the
 first 10 s.
 The area is negative, because the force is negative.
 From Equation 6.3, we know the impulse is equal to the change in momentum.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $m\overrightarrow{v_{i}}=50kg\times8.0m/s=+400kg\;m/s$
\end_inset

 .
 Her momentum at t = 10 s is therefore + 400kg m/s - 100kg m/s = + 300kg
 m/s .
 Dividing this by the mass to find the velocity at t = 10 s confirms what
 we found above: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{v}_{10s}=\dfrac{\overrightarrow{p_{10s}}}{m}=\dfrac{\overrightarrow{p_{i}}+\triangle\overrightarrow{p}}{m}=\dfrac{+400kgm/s-100kgm/s}{50kg}=\dfrac{+300kgm/s}{50kg}=+6.0m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 4 - What is Suki’s speed at t = 30 s? Let’s use the area under the
 force-versus-time graph, between t = 10 s and t = 30 s, to find Suki’s
 change in momentum over that 20-second period.
 This area is highlighted in Figure 6.5, split into a negative area for the
 time between t = 10 s and t = 15 s, and a positive area between t = 15
 s and t = 30 s.
 These regions are triangles, so we can use the equation for the area of
 a triangle, 0.5 × base × height .
 The area under the curve, between 10 s and 15 s, is 0.5 × (5.0s) ×( - 10
 N) = - 25kg m/s .
 The area between 15 s and 30 s is 0.5 × (15s) × (30 N) = + 225kg m/s .
 The total area (total change in momentum) is +200 kg m/s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that another approach is to multiply the average net force acting on
 Suki and the bicycle (+10 N) over this interval, by the time interval (20
 s), for a +200 kg m/s change in momentum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
In step 3, we determined that Suki’s momentum at t = 10 s is +300 kg m/s.
 With the additional 200 kg m/s, the net momentum at t = 10 s is +500 kg
 m/s.
 Dividing by the 50 kg mass gives a velocity at t = 30 s of +10 m/s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Key idea for the graphical interpretation of impulse: The area under the
 net force versus time graph for a particular time interval is equal to
 the change in momentum during that time interval.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider this graph, if the "clock" is started at 0.05 (where the mass is
 at it's maximum stretch) seconds then there would be a phase shift of 90
 degrees (or we could replace the sine function for a cosine).
 If the "clock" is started at 0.1 seconds (where mass moves down instead
 of up; left instead of right) then the phase shift would be 180 degrees
 (a negative sine function).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Velocity vs time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the position verses time graph, at any point were the mass has
 reached the amplitude (maximum distance from from the equilibrium point)
 the speed of the mass at these point is zero.
 When the position is at zero then the speed is at a maximum (if you don't
 believe it, consider conservation of energy).
 This "shifts" the position graph by 90 degrees "creating" a cosine graph
 for velocity.
 The other way of thinking about is velocity is the change in position with
 respect to time, the change in a sine wave with respect to time is a cosine
 graph.

Acceleration vs time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The acceleration verse time graph is the easiest of the graphs to make.
 The simple harmonic motion is based on a relationship between position
 and acceleration; x = - Ka.
 So the graph of position and acceleration should look alike, except for
 the negative sign.
 In fact position and acceleration are the same shape just mirror copies
 of each other.

Peak Height
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that the shapes of each graph is simular, that each
 graph has the same frequency, period and wavelength, but they don't have
 the same amplitude, for common simple harmonic motion, the height the peak
 of the function (not to confused with the amplitude, amplitude refers to
 the height of the position graph alone, i'm talking about the height of
 the position, velocity and acceleration graphs) tend to get smaller and
 smaller starting with the position graph being the tallest and the acceleration
 being the shortest.

Graphing position, velocity, and acceleration with respect to each other
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphing position to the other functions can be complicated and when tested
 on it, most student are unable to give the right answer.
 First consider this, for simple harmonic motion position and acceleration
 are proportional.
 x = -k a this is a linear relationship so the graph is a line, the slope
 is negative so the line is heading down.

Position and acceleration verses velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The position and acceleration verse velocity graph look entirely different.
 First off the straight line test fails when plotting position vs velocity
 or acceleration verse velocity.
 Take the point were x and a are zero, there are two possible answers for
 the point (the speed maybe at maximum) the object could be moving down
 or up at the point.
 That means the velocity can be a positive maximum or a negative maximum,
 two separate values.
 Looking a the points were the velocity is equal to zero, there are two
 possible answers, either at the top or at the bottom.
 If you continue to plot data points graph that is developed is a ellisipe

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 1 let the charge on a capacitor of capacitance C at any instant
 be q, and let V be the potential difference across it at that instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current (I) in the discharge at that instant is therefore: I = - dq/dt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But V = IR and q = CV so dq/dt = d(CV)/dt = C dV/dt Therefore we have V
 = -CR dV/dt Rearranging and integrating gives:

Capacitor discharge (voltage decay): 
\begin_inset Formula $V=V_{o}e-^{(t/RC)}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
where Vo is the initial voltage applied to the capacitor.
 A graph of this exponential discharge is shown below in Figure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since Q = CV the equation for the charge (Q) on the capacitor after a time
 t is therefore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Capacitor discharge (charge decay): 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=Q_{o}e^{-(t/RC)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
V = 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{o}e^{-(t/RC)}$

\begin_inset Formula $Q=Q_{o}e^{-(t/RC)}$

\begin_layout Standard
You should realise that the term RC governs the rate at which the charge
 on the capacitor decays.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When t = RC, V = Vo/e = 0.37 Vo and the product RC is known as the time constant
 for the circuit.
 The bigger the value of RC the slower the rate at which the capacitor discharge
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value of C can be found from this discharge curve if R is known.

As the capacitor charges the charging current decreases since the potential
 across the resistance decreases as the potential across the capacitor increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure  shows how both the potential difference across the capacitor and
 the charge on the plates vary with time during charging.

The charging current would be given by the gradient of the curve in Figure

Figure shows a graph where the reciprocal of the image distance is plotted
 against the reciprocal of the object distance.
 The graph is a straight line that intercepts both axes at 1/f where f is
 the focal length of the lens.
 Since the object is real this graph is for a convex lens.
