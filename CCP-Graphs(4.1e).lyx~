This book is a plethora on Graphs.
 Usually this topic , i.e.
 GRAPHS is studied with lots of hype in Coachings, but unfortunately , not
 lots of good study material is available.
 This book fulfills a long felt need by students and teachers for an authorative
 text on graphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This book contains only reviewed material already being used by millions
 of professors in universities.
 Reason being, to keep the correctness and homogeneity intact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source of most graphs in this book is either internet or already published
 books , proper bibliography has been added to give credit to seemingly
 original creators.

\begin_layout Standard
A graph is an accurate pictorial representation of data.
 The accuracy of data in physics requires that graphs be made on good quality
 graph paper.
 Nearly all graphs in physics are smooth line graphs; broken line (connect
 the dots) graphs and bar graphs are seldom appropriate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The style and format of a graph will depend upon its intended purpose.
 Three types are common in physics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 PICTORIAL GRAPHS.
 These are the kind found in mathematics and physics textbooks.
 Their purpose is to simply and clearly illustrate a mathematical relation.
 No attempt is made to show data points or errors on such a graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 DISPLAY GRAPHS.
 These present the data from an experiment.
 They are found in laboratory reports, research journals, and sometimes
 in textbooks.
 They show the data points as well as a smooth line representing the mathematica
l relation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 COMPUTATIONAL GRAPHS.
 These are drawn for the purpose of extracting a numerical result from the
 data.
 An example is the calculation of the slope of a straight line graph, or
 its intercepts.

Certain informational and stylistic features are required in all graphs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 The graph must have a descriptive title or caption, clearly stating what
 the graph illustrates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Data points are plotted as small dots with a sharp pencil, or as pinpricks.
 Some method should be used to emphasize the location of the points, for
 example, a neat circle drawn around each point.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A French curve is a template usually made from metal, wood or plastic composed
 of many different curves.
 It is used in manual drafting to draw smooth curves of varying radii.
 The shapes are segments of the Euler spiral or clothoid curve.
 The curve is placed on the drawing material, and a pencil, knife or other
 implement is traced around its curves to produce the desired result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Modern computer-aided design (CAD) systems use vector-based graphics to
 achieve a precise radius, so no template is required.
 Digital computers can also be used to generate a set of coordinates that
 accurately describe an arbitrary curve, and the points can be connected
 with line segments to approximate the curve with a high degree of accuracy.
 Some computer-graphics systems make use of Bézier curves, which allow a
 curve to be bent in real time on a display screen to follow a set of coordinate
s, much in the way a French curve would be placed on a set of three or four
 points on paper.

 The curve should stand out clearly.

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Choose scales that are convenient to plot and easy to read.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Choose scales such that the graph occupies most of the page.
 The two scales need not have the same size units.
 Also, the scales need not begin at zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Indicate the name, letter symbol and units of each variable plotted on
 each axis.

\begin_layout Standard
PHYSICAL SLOPE AND GEOMETRIC SLOPE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slope.
 When textbooks refer to the "slope" of a plotted graph line we mean the
 "physical slope"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
physical slope = 
\begin_inset Formula $\dfrac{\text{Δ}y}{\text{Δ}x}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where Δy and Δx are expressed in the physical units of the x and y axes.
 This slope has physical significance in describing the physical data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Geometric slope.
 A line which makes a 45° angle with an axis will not necessarily have a
 physical slope of size 1.
 Some authors introduce the term "geometric slope" to describe the tilt
 of the line on the page.
 This is a ratio of lengths of the legs of the triangle, without reference
 to the units plotted on the axes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is seldom (probably never) any need to calculate the geometric slope
 of a line on a graph.
 The idea is only useful when describing the appearance of the graph on
 the page.
 One rule of graph construction states that the graph should occupy most
 of the page.
 For square graph paper this suggests a geometric slope of 45°.
 See Fig for examples of good and bad choices of geometric slope.

Nothing should be in the white margins except a page number.

Graphical Representation of Uncertainties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Display graphs and computational graphs should clearly show the size of
 the experimental uncertainties (errors) in each plotted point.
 There are several conventional ways to do this, the commonest being the
 use of error bars illustrated below:

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plotted point is represented as a dot, and the range of uncertainty
 is shown by the extent of the bars on either side.
 The types shown in (a) are suitable where the error is entirely in one
 variable, or where the errors in both variables have been lumped together.
 The types shown in (b) are preferred where it is necessary to show the
 error in each variable explicitly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the uncertainties have a symmetric distribution about the mean, the
 error bars extend equally on either side of the points.
 If the data distributions are not symmetric, the plotted points will not
 be centrally located in the range of uncertainty and the error bars might
 look like those in Figure.
 part (c).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Error bars may not be necessary when the data points are so numerous that
 their scatter is clearly shows the uncertainty.
 In these cases error bars would clutter the graph making it difficult to
 interpret.
 Another situation where error bars are inappropriate is when the scale
 of the graph is such that the bars would be very small.
 In this case, it may be possible to indicate the uncertainty by the size
 of the circle or rectangle surrounding each point.

Curve Fitting

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Curve Fitting
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curve drawn through plotted data need not pass exactly through every
 data point.
 But usually the curve should pass within the uncertainty range of each
 point, that is, within the error bars, if the bars represent limits of
 error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One principle of curve fitting is also a fundamental rule of science itself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume the simplest relation consistent with the data.
 We are not justified in assuming a more complex relation than can be demonstrat
ed by the data.
 If a curve were drawn with detail smaller than the data uncertainty, that
 detail would be only a guess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This rule of simplicity may also be expressed mathematically.
 The mathematical relations encountered in physics may often be represented
 by power series such as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $y=A+Bx+Cx^{2}+Dx^{3}+Ex^{4}+...$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where A, B, C, ...
 are constants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For very "wiggly" curves, many terms of this equation, including high powers
 of x, might be required to express the equation of the relation.
 The simplest relations are those which contain the smallest powers of x.
 The simplest relations of all are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
y = a or y = a + bx
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which describe straight lines.
 Many relations in physics are, fortunately, of this form.
 Others only include the 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

 term, describing a parabolic curve.
 Note that double valued curves, sometimes encountered in physics, cannot
 be represented by Equation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When sizable amounts of data are taken, standard mathematical methods are
 available which generate the equation of the simplest curve which statistically
 "best fits" the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The student may wonder how one can be certain that the curve fitted to the
 data is the "correct" curve.
 The answer is that relations are never known with certainty.
 The uncertainty of available data always limits the certainty of the results.
 Someday someone may obtain more accurate data and be able to show that
 the old relations are slightly incorrect, and provide us with better ones.
 As data improves, so does our understanding of relations—this is the way
 of scientific progress.
 But we never should claim to know a relation better than the data allows.

Uncertainty in a Slope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One use of a computational graph is to determine the slope of a straight
 line.
 This is illustrated in Figure.
 Eight data points are shown with error bars on each.
 If these bars represent maximum error, any line drawn to represent this
 data should pass within all bars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the error bars represent error estimates smaller than the maximum (average
 deviation, standard deviation, etc.), then the fitted curve need not pass
 within all of the error bars, just most of them.

The dotted lines A and C fall within the error bars, and represent the maximum
 and minimum slope one could justify from this data.
 The "best" value of slope might be that of solid line B.

The third point from the left seems to limit the slope the most, and would
 appear to be "suspect." But one ought not to "throw it out" without better
 reason, based on further investigation.

Graphs can be a valuable tool for determining or verifying functional relations
 between variables.
 Many special types of graph paper are available for handling the most frequentl
y encountered relations.
 You are probably already familiar with linear graph paper and polar coordinate
 paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may have purchased a packet of graph paper for this course.
 It includes samples of graph papers you will use in this course, and a
 few other types.
 As you read the material below, examine the corresponding papers from your

LINEAR RELATIONS are those which satisfy the equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
y = mx + b
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the variables are x and y, and m and b are constants.
 When y is plotted against x on ordinary Cartesian (linear) graph paper,
 the points fall on a straight line with slope m and a y-intercept b, as
 shown in Fig.

 illustrates this, the slope being Δy/Δx.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far this discussion has been strictly mathematical.
 Now let's consider a fairly realistic physical example.
 Figure.
 shows the curve from measurements of the velocity of a moving body as a
 function of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we use letters v for velocity and t for time, we'd expect this curve
 to be described by the relation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 + at
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here the constant a (acceleration) is the slope of the line, while v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 plays the role of b in Equation.
 These two constants are physically significant, and we wish to find their
 values from the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We choose two points on the line at t = 4.25 and 8.75, with corresponding
 values of velocity: 42 cm/s and 98 cm/s.
 Mark these points on Figure.
 , to confirm these values.
 The slope of the line is therefore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $a=\dfrac{(98cm/s-42cm/s)}{8.75s-4.25s}=\dfrac{56}{4.5}\;cm/s^{2}=56/4.5\;cm/s^{2}=12.44cm/s^{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When calculating this ratio do not use ruler-measured lengths.
 The lengths are expressed in the units marked on the graph axes.
 The calculated slope is therefore independent of the particular choice
 of units, of the way you choose to label the graph scale divisions, and
 is also independent of the size of the graph paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
INTERCEPTS: The values of the intercepts are often physically significant.
 They can be simply read from the graph—if the 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset

 axes happen to be within the graph's boundaries.
 In the equation y = mx + b, the y intercept is b.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The v intercept of Figure.
 is the value of v when t = 0.
 It has the same units and dimensions as y.
 If, as in this case, the v intercept does not lie within the area of the
 graph, it may be calculated using the slope and one value taken from a
 point on the fitted line.
 Take the point v = 98 cm/s when t = 8.75 sec.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 + at , in our case, v = v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
so,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = v
\begin_inset Formula $_{o}$
\end_inset

 - 12.44 t = 98 - 12.44(8.75) = -10.89 cm/s A check of the graph, Figure.
 , shows that this looks reasonable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
STRAIGHTENING A CURVE.
 When it is possible to convert an experimental relation to a straight line
 graph it is usually useful to do so.
 Look for such opportunities.
 For example, when studying gases at constant temperature we find that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PV = C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where P is pressure, V is the gas volume and C is constant.
 The graph of P vs.
 V is a branch of an hyperbola.
 But if we graph P vs.
 1/V, or V vs.
 1/P, the data would fall on a straight line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $P=\left(\dfrac{1}{V}\right)C$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One reason for doing this is that it is easier to fit the experimental data
 with a ruler-drawn straight line, than to draw the best hyperbola on a
 PV graph.
 Another advantage is that the P vs.
 1/V graph has a slope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $C=\dfrac{\triangle P}{\triangle\left(\dfrac{1}{V}\right)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore the constant C is easily determined from the straight line.
 This constant was not evident, nor was it easy to determine from the PV
 graph!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inexpensive electronic calculators make it so easy to manipulate data that
 there is no good excuse to pass up an opportunity to "linearize" experimental
 graphs.

Common Graph Forms in Physics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Working with graphs – interpreting, creating, and employing – is an essential
 skill in the sciences, and especially in physics where relationships need
 to be derived.
 As an introductory physics student you should be familiar with the typical
 forms of graphs that appear in physics.
 Below are a number of typical physical relationships exhibited graphically
 using standard X-Y coordinates (e.g., no logarithmic, power, trigonometric,
 or inverse plots, etc.).
 Study the forms of the graphs carefully, and be prepared to use the program
 Graphical Analysis to formulate relationships between variables by using
 appropriate curve-fitting strategies.
 Note that all non-linear forms of graphs can be made to appear linear by
 “linearizing” the data.
 Linearization consists of such things as plotting X versus Y
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

 or X versus 1/Y or Y versus log (X), etc.
 Note: While a 5th order polynomial might give you a better fit to the data,
 it might not represent the simplest model.

\begin_layout Standard
What happens if you get a graph of data that looks like this? How does one
 relate the X variable to the Y variable? It’s simple, Y = A + BX where
 B is the slope of the line and A is the Y-intercept.
 This is characteristic of Newton’s second law of motion and of Charles’
 law:

Inverse Relationship

\begin_layout Standard
This might be a graph of the pressure and temperature for a changing volume
 constant temperature gas.
 How would you find this relationship short of using a computer package?
 The answer is to simplify the plot by manipulating the data.
 Plot the Y variable versus the inverse of the X variable.
 The graph becomes a straight line.
 The resulting formula will be Y = A/X or XY = A.
 This is typical of Boyle’s law:

In the latter two examples above there are only subtle differences in form.
 Many common graph forms in physics appear quite similar.
 Only by looking at the “RMSE” (root mean square error provided in Graphical
 Analysis) can one conclude whether one fit is better than another.
 The better fit is the one with the smaller RMSE.
 See below for more examples of common graph forms in physics.

\begin_layout Standard
Since you are not allowed to use calculators, SAT II Physics places a heavy
 emphasis on qualitative problems.
 A common way of testing kinematics qualitatively is to present you with
 a graph plotting position vs.
 time, velocity vs.
 time, or acceleration vs.
 time and to ask you questions about the motion of the object represented
 by the graph.
 Because SAT II Physics is entirely made up of multiple-choice questions,
 you won’t need to know how to draw graphs; you’ll just have to interpret
 the data presented in them.
 Knowing how to read such graphs quickly and accurately will not only help
 you solve problems of this sort, it will also help you visualize the often-abst
ract realm of kinematic equations.
 In the examples that follow, we will examine the movement of an ant running
 back and forth along a line.

Position vs.
 time graphs give you an easy and obvious way of determining an object’s
 displacement at any given time, and a subtler way of determining that object’s

 Let’s put these concepts into practice by looking at the following graph

\begin_layout Standard
Any point on this graph gives us the position of the ant at a particular
 moment in time.
 For instance, the point at (2,–2) tells us that, two seconds after it started
 moving, the ant was two centimeters to the left of its starting position,
 and the point at (3,1) tells us that, three seconds after it started moving,
 the ant is one centimeter to the right of its starting position.
 Let’s read what the graph can tell us about the ant’s movements.
 For the first two seconds, the ant is moving to the left.
 Then, in the next second, it reverses its direction and moves quickly to
 y = 1.
 The ant then stays still at y = 1 for three seconds before it turns left
 again and moves back to where it started.
 Note how concisely the graph displays all this information.
 Calculating Velocity We know the ant’s displacement, and we know how long
 it takes to move from place to place.
 Armed with this information, we should also be able to determine the ant’s
 velocity, since velocity measures the rate of change of displacement over
 time.
 If displacement is given here by the vector y, then the velocity of the
 ant is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $v=\dfrac{\triangle y}{\triangle t}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you recall, the slope of a graph is a measure of rise over run; that
 is, the amount of change in the y direction divided by the amount of change
 in the x direction.
 In our graph, is the change in the y direction and is the change in the
 x direction, so v is a measure of the slope of the graph.
 For any position vs.
 time graph, the velocity at time t is equal to the slope of the line at
 t.
 In a graph made up of straight lines, like the one above, we can easily
 calculate the slope at each point on the graph, and hence know the instantaneou
s velocity at any given time.
 We can tell that the ant has a velocity of zero from t = 3 to t = 6, because
 the slope of the line at these points is zero.
 We can also tell that the ant is cruising along at the fastest speed between
 t = 2 and t = 3, because the position vs.
 time graph is steepest between these points.
 Calculating the ant’s average velocity during this time interval is a simple
 matter of dividing rise by run, as we’ve learned in math class.

How about the average velocity between t = 0 and t = 3? It’s actually easier
 to sort this out with a graph in front of us, because it’s easy to see
 the displacement at t = 0 and t = 3, and so that we don’t confuse displacement
 and distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Average Speed 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the total displacement in the first three seconds is one centimeter
 to the right, the total distance traveled is two centimeters to the left,
 and then three centimeters to the right, for a grand total of five centimeters.
 Thus, the average speed is not the same as the average velocity of the
 ant.
 Once we’ve calculated the total distance traveled by the ant, though, calculati
ng its average speed is not difficult:

Curved Position vs.
 Time Graphs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is all well and good, but how do you calculate the velocity of a curved
 position vs.
 time graph? Well, the bad news is that you’d need calculus.
 The good news is that SAT II Physics doesn’t expect you to use calculus,
 so if you are given a curved position vs.
 time graph, you will only be asked qualitative questions and won’t be expected
 to make any calculations.
 A few points on the graph will probably be labeled, and you will have to
 identify which point has the greatest or least velocity.
 Remember, the point with the greatest slope has the greatest velocity,
 and the point with the least slope has the least velocity.
 The turning points of the graph, the tops of the “hills” and the bottoms
 of the “valleys” where the slope is zero, have zero velocity.

In this graph, for example, the velocity is zero at points A and C, greatest
 at point D, and smallest at point B.
 The velocity at point B is smallest because the slope at that point is
 negative.
 Because velocity is a vector quantity, the velocity at B would be a large
 negative number.
 However, the speed at B is greater even than the speed at D: speed is a
 scalar quantity, and so it is always positive.
 The slope at B is even steeper than at D, so the speed is greatest at B.
 Velocity vs.
 Time Graphs Velocity vs.
 time graphs are the most eloquent kind of graph we’ll be looking at here.
 They tell us very directly what the velocity of an object is at any given
 time, and they provide subtle means for determining both the position and
 acceleration of the same object over time.
 The “object” whose velocity is graphed below is our ever-industrious ant,
 a little later in the day.

We can learn two things about the ant’s velocity by a quick glance at the
 graph.
 First, we can tell exactly how fast it is going at any given time.
 For instance, we can see that, two seconds after it started to move, the
 ant is moving at 2 cm/s.
 Second, we can tell in which direction the ant is moving.
 From t = 0 to t = 4, the velocity is positive, meaning that the ant is
 moving to the right.
 From t = 4 to t = 7, the velocity is negative, meaning that the ant is
 moving to the left.
 Calculating Acceleration We can calculate acceleration on a velocity vs.
 time graph in the same way that we calculate velocity on a position vs.
 time graph.
 Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity vector, , which expresses
 itself as the slope of the velocity vs.
 time graph.
 For a velocity vs.
 time graph, the acceleration at time t is equal to the slope of the line
 at t.
 What is the acceleration of our ant at t = 2.5 and t = 4? Looking quickly
 at the graph, we see that the slope of the line at t = 2.5 is zero and hence
 the acceleration is likewise zero.
 The slope of the graph between t = 3 and t = 5 is constant, so we can calculate
 the acceleration at t = 4 by calculating the average acceleration between
 t = 3 and t = 5:

The minus sign tells us that acceleration is in the leftward direction,
 since we’ve defined the y-coordinates in such a way that right is positive
 and left is negative.
 At t = 3, the ant is moving to the right at 2 cm/s, so a leftward acceleration
 means that the ant begins to slow down.
 Looking at the graph, we can see that the ant comes to a stop at t = 4,
 and then begins accelerating to the right.

\begin_layout Subsection
Calculating Displacement 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Velocity vs.
 time graphs can also tell us about an object’s displacement.
 Because velocity is a measure of displacement over time, we can infer that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
displacement = velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphically, this means that the displacement in a given time interval is
 equal to the area under the graph during that same time interval.
 If the graph is above the t-axis, then the positive displacement is the
 area between the graph and the t-axis.
 If the graph is below the t-axis, then the displacement is negative, and
 is the area between the graph and the t-axis.
 Let’s look at two examples to make this rule clearer.
 First, what is the ant’s displacement between t = 2 and t = 3? Because
 the velocity is constant during this time interval, the area between the
 graph and the t-axis is a rectangle of width 1 and height 2.

The area of the shaded region, and consequently the change in velocity during

 that the velocity is 3 cm/s greater than it was at t = 2.
 Since we have not been given the velocity at t = 2, we can’t immediately
 say what the velocity is at t = 5.
 Summary of Rules for Reading Graphs You may have trouble recalling when
 to look for the slope and when to look for the area under the graph.
 Here are a couple handy rules of thumb: The slope on a given graph is equivalen
t to the quantity we get by dividing the y-axis by the x-axis.
 For instance, the y-axis of a position vs.
 time graph gives us displacement, and the x-axis gives us time.
 Displacement divided by time gives us velocity, which is what the slope
 of a position vs.
 time graph represents.
 The area under a given graph is equivalent to the quantity we get by multiplyin
g the x-axis and the y-axis.
 For instance, the y-axis of an acceleration vs.
 time graph gives us acceleration, and the x-axis gives us time.
 Acceleration multiplied by time gives us the change in velocity, which
 is what the area between the graph and the x-axis represents.
 We can summarize what we know about graphs in a table:

 he remembers that he has to buy something in a shop that he has passed
 by, so he turns around and walks at a velocity of -1 m/s for 10 s.
 He then stops for 30 s at the shop, and finally walks forward again at
 0.5 m/s for another 20 s.
 Plot a displacement-time graph for the motion of the boy.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Strong

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Solution
\end_layout

\end_inset

 : a.) The total distance traveled by the object is the sum of all the distances
 it traveled during the time interval.
 In the first two seconds it traveled 3 m.
 Then it traveled 0 m in the next two seconds.
 Then over the next five seconds, the object moved 5 m, then remained at
 rest.
 so the total distance is 3 + 5 = 8 m.
 The displacement of the object is simply the final position minus the initial
 position, or -2 - 0 = -2 m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.) Notice that each of these points is in the middle of a line segment on
 the graph.
 Because of this, the instantaneous velocity at these points is the same
 as the average velocity over the time intervals represented by each segment,
 so: v(t) = (xf - xi)/(tf - ti) v(1) = (3 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 3/2 = 1.5 m/s v(3)
 = (3 - 3)/(4 - 2) = 0/2 = 0 m/s v(6) = (-2 - 3)/(9 - 4) = -5/5 = -1 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the formula (xf - xi)/(tf - ti) is the same as the slope formula
 for this graph.
 The velocity at any point on a position vs.
 time graph is simply the slope of the graph at that point.
 By this definition, we also know that the velocity of any position function
 is its derivative with respect to time.
 You can also go from a velocity function to a position function using integrati
on.
 Go to calculus notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.) Average velocity is displacement divided by time.
 We found in part a that the object's displacement is -2 m, so: vavg = -2/10
 = -0.2 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Average speed is total distance divided be time, and we found in part a
 that the object's total distance traveled is 8 m.
 so: 8/10 = 0.8 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d.) We determined in part b that the object's velocity is represented by
 the slope of the line segment on the graph.
 Since the slope of this segment is constant, the object's velocity at t
 = 5 is constant.
 Since constant velocity means there is no acceleration, a = 0.

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the problem above, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First car's (red) distance at time t is found by finding the area of the
 trapezoid whose boundary is the t-axis, the red lines and the vertical
 line representing time at t seconds.
 This of course assumes t>15 (otherwise, we have negative distances, and
 the trapezoid only starts at t=15.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the distance (at time t)
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle =\frac{1}{2}\times13.5\left(t+t-15\right)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
= The distance of the second car (blue) is found by finding the area of
 the blue trapezoid, bounded by the blue lines, the t-axis and the vertical
 line.
 (And this one assumes t>20, for the same reasons as above.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the distance (at time t)
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle =\frac{1}{2}\times17\left(t+t-20\right)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distance when they meet is the same, so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\times13.5\times\left(2t-15\right)}$
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\times17\times\left(2t-20\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Solving gives:

\begin_layout Standard
Time =19.643 s

\begin_layout Standard
Distance=163.93 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dilemma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this solution gives us a dilemma.
 As mentioned above, the expressions we found for the area of the trapezoids
 required t to be more than 15 s and 20 s, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can confirm the blue car overtakes the red car before 20 seconds, by
 calculating the distances travelled at that time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After 20 seconds:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Red car has travelled 0.5×(20+5)×13.5=168.75 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blue car has travelled 0.5×20×17=170 m The blue car has travelled further
 than the red car, so it means it has already overtaken the red car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back to the drawing board
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, in fact, for this question we need to consider the area of the blue

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Solving gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
t =12.14 s, t = 19.63 s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first solution has no practical meaning, since t>15 for the expression
 to work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we conclude the time taken for the blue car to overtake the red car is
 19.63 s and the distance travelled at that time is 163.7 m.

\begin_layout Standard
Further Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate we have found the correct answer, below is the graph of distance
 against time.
 Labelling of axes is very important in this work!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The red curve corresponds to the acceleration portion of the first race
 car.
 At t=15, or point C(15,101.25), the red car stops accelerating and continues
 at a constant speed (CA is no longer a curve, but a straight line).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blue curve corresponds to the second (blue) car.
 It doesn't accelerate as hard (its curve is below the red curve, indicating
 it covers less distance in the same time), but it accelerates for longer.
 At t=20, or point D (20,170), it stops accelerating and its graph is now
 a straight line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can see the curves intersect at time t=19.63 s, or point A (19.63,163.7),
 as we found in the calculation above.
 This means they have covered the same distance (163.7 m) at that time, so
 that's when the blue car passes the red car.

Solution
\end_layout

\end_inset

 : (Hint : In this problem, you are asked to describe the motion of the
 car.
 Whenever you are asked to describe the motion of an object without worrying
 about the cause of that motion, you have a kinematics problem.
 This problem is different from most kinematics problems, however, in that
 you are not asked for a numerical description but rather to use words and
 graphs to describe how the car moves.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Queries : How did you know that x = 0 at t = 0? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You don’t! If you are given a velocity-time graph, you know the initial
 speed but not the initial location of the object.
 (Calculus students, remember v = dx/dt, and the derivative of a constant—your
 initial location—is zero.) I chose to call the location of the car at t
 = 0 the origin, but you could start your graph at any point.
 The shape of the graph, however, should look the same.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why can’t I treat the straight line from t1 to t3 in a single step? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any time velocity is above the t-axis, it has a positive value and so slope
 of the x-t graph is also positive.
 A positive slope means that the line or curve is in such a direction as
 to make between a 0 and a 900 angle above the +x axis.
 Any time velocity is below the t-axis, it has a negative value and so the
 slope of the x-t graph is also negative.
 A negative slope means that the line or curve is in such a direction as
 to make between a 0 and a 900 angle below the +x axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why doesn’t the line from t3 to t4 look more curved? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the velocity-time curve gets closer and closer to v = 0 (the t-axis),
 velocity’s value is getting smaller regardless of direction.
 As the value of v decreases, so does the slope of the x-t graph.
 A decreasing slope means that the slope gets smaller and smaller—the line
 gets becomes more horizontal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curve from t3 to t4 on the x-t graph shown here doesn’t look very curved.
 This is because its slope goes from the same value as it ended with on
 the t2 to t3 curve to almost zero (a horizontal line) and so not a lot
 of change as I have drawn it.
 Any line you draw that curves down and to the right becoming more horizontal
 as it goes is fine.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Select a relation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To go between a velocity-time graph and a displacement-time or acceleration-time
 graph, you need to understand how velocity, displacement and acceleration
 are related to each other.
 In other words, you need to use the definitions of velocity and acceleration:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v = Δx/Δt In words, the value of velocity = the slope of the x-t graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a = Δv/Δt In words, the value of acceleration = the slope of the v-t graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: Graphing problems seem like they should be straightforward, and the
 equations that you need are only those given above.
 It is very, very common, however, to make mistakes on these problems because
 it feels like the graphs should be pictures of the motion and they are
 not.
 In order to avoid those mistakes, make a table based on the sentences above
 and then draw the graph from the table.

Understand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this problem, you are given the velocity-time graph for the motion of
 a car.
 By relating the value of velocity to the slope of the x-t graph (this is
 just the definition of velocity) you are able to draw the x-t graph correspondi
ng to this motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By relating the slope of the v-t graph to the value of acceleration (this
 is just the definition of acceleration) you are able to draw the a-t graph
 corresponding to this motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can describe the motion looking at any of the three graphs.
 From t = 0 to t1 : The car travels forward (+ direction) with a constant
 speed.
 There is no acceleration and the car moves away from its starting point
 at a constant rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From t1 to t2 : The car slows to a stop at a constant rate.
 It is still moving forward, but the amount of distance it covers in each
 second is decreasing.
 Acceleration acts against the motion of the car, or in the negative direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From t2 to t3 : The car reverses direction, moving faster and faster (at
 a constant acceleration) in the negative direction.
 Acceleration is acting with the motion of the car, so it is also in the
 negative direction.
 The amount of distance the car covers each second increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From t3 to t4 : The car continues to move in the negative direction but
 at a decreasing speed.
 The rate at which the speed decreases is getting greater—the driver is
 braking harder as the car stops—and so acceleration increases.
 Acceleration is acting against the motion of the car, or in the positive
 direction.
 The car covers less and less distance each second.

 fashion, except areas below the x-axis are considered negative: 3 + 6 +
 4.5 - 2 - 2 = 9.5 m Interestingly enough, the area enclosed by any function
 can be represented by a definite integral.
 For example, if this graph were defined as a function v(t), then the displaceme
nt would be the integral from 0 to 10 of v(t)dt, and the total distance
 traveled would be the integral from 0 to 10 of |v(t)|dt Go to calculus

b.) The position of the object at a given point in time can be found in much
 the same way we found the displacement in part a, except this time we must
 also add in the initial value given.
 So: x(2) = 2 + 3 = 5 m x(4) = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 m x(7) = 2 + 3 + 6 + 4.5 =
 15.5 m x(10) = 2 + 3 + 6 + 4.5 - 2 - 2 = 11.5 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that this can also be done by adding the integral from 0 to t of
 v(t)dt to the initial value of 2.

c.) Like velocity in part b of problem 22, the instantaneous acceleration
 at any point along one of the graph's line segments is the same as the
 average acceleration across that line segment.
 The formula for acceleration is aavg = Δv/Δt = (vf - vi)/(tf - ti), so:
 a(t) = (vf - vi)/(tf - ti) a(1) = (3 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 3/2 = 1.5 m/s2 a(3)
 = (3 - 3)/(4 - 2) = 0/2 = 0 m/s2 a(6) = (-2 - 3)/(9 - 4) = -5/5 = -1 m/s2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to the relationship between velocity and position, the formula
 for acceleration is the same as the slope formula for a velocity vs.
 time graph.
 So, we can say that the slope of any velocity vs.
 time graph is its acceleration.
 Notice that this definition defines acceleration as the derivative of velocity.
 So, it is true that for any velocity function v(t), its derivative is an
 acceleration function a(t).
 Also, integration can be used to go from an acceleration function to a
 position function.

\begin_layout Standard
d.) We know that the acceleration along each line segment of this velocity
 vs.
 time graph is equal to the slope of the line segment.
 We determined these slopes in part c, so the acceleration graph would look

This graph uses horizontal lines instead of points to represent that the
 acceleration is defined at that value at any point along that section.
 The open circles at the end of each line segment simply indicate that at
 those time values, acceleration is not defined at either value represented
 by the horizontal lines.
 At these points, acceleration is undefined because it changes instantaneously
 from one value to the next, which cannot be represented numerically.

 Which object(s) is(are) maintaining a state of motion (i.e., maintaining
 a constant velocity)? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer ; Objects A, B, D, and E.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects A, B, D, and E are maintaining a state of motion (i.e., remaining
 with constant velocity) as demonstrated by the constant slope.
 If the slope is constant, then the velocity is constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Which object(s) is(are) accelerating? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object C is accelerating.
 An accelerating object has a changing velocity.
 Since the slope of a p-t graph equals the velocity, an accelerating object
 is represented by a changing slope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Which object(s) is(are) not moving? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Objects A and E.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects A and E are not moving.
 An object which is not moving has a zero velocity; this translates into
 a line with zero slope on a p-t graph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Which object(s) change(s) its direction? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : None of the objects change direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of these objects change direction.
 An object changes its direction if it changes from a + to a - velocity
 (or vice versa).
 This translates into a p-t graph with a + slope and then a - slope (or
 vice versa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 On average, which object is traveling fastest? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object B is traveling fastest.
 To be traveling fastest is to have the greatest speed (or greatest magnitude
 of velocity).
 This translates into the line on a p-t graph with the greatest slope.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 On average, which moving object is traveling slowest? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object D.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object D is traveling slowest.
 To be traveling slowest is to have the smallest speed (or smallest magnitude
 of velocity).
 This translates into the line on a p-t graph with the smallest slope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Which object has the greatest acceleration? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer ; Object C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Objects A and E.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects A and E are maintaining their state of motion.
 To maintain the state of motion is to keep a constant velocity (i.e., to
 have a zero acceleration).
 This translates into a zero slope on a v-t graph.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Objects B and C (and D during the first part of its motion).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects B and C are accelerating (and for a while, object D).
 Accelerated motion is indicated by a sloped line on a v-t graph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
10.
 Which object(s) is(are) not moving? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Each of the objects are moving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the objects are moving.
 If an object were not moving, then the v-t graph would be a horizontal
 line along the axis (v = 0 m/s).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
11.
 Which object(s) change(s) its direction? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Objects B and C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects B and C change their direction.
 An object that is changing its direction is changing from a + to a - velocity.
 Thus, the line on a v-t graph will pass from the + to the - region of the
 graph.
 Object D is not changing its direction; object D first moves in the - direction
 with increasing speed and then maintains a constant speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
12.
 Which accelerating object has the smallest acceleration? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : Object B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Sketch a velocity-time graph for an object moving with a constant speed
 in the positive direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object moving with a constant speed
 in the positive direction is shown below.
 To have "a constant speed in the positive direction" is to have a + velocity
 which is unchanging.
 Thus, the line on the graph will be in the + region of the graph (above
 0).
 Since the velocity is unchanging, the line is horizontal.
 Since the slope of a line on a v-t graph is the object's acceleration,
 a horizontal line (zero slope) on a v-t graph is characteristic of a motion
 with zeo acceleration (constant velocity).

 Sketch a velocity-time graph for an object moving with a constant speed
 in the negative direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object moving with a constant speed
 in the negative direction is shown below.
 To have "a constant speed in the negative direction" is to have a - velocity
 which is unchanging.
 Thus, the line on the graph will be in the - region of the graph (below
 0).
 Since the velocity is unchanging, the line is horizontal.
 Since the slope of a line on a v-t graph is the object's acceleration,
 a horizontal line (zero slope) on a v-t graph is characteristic of a motion
 with zeo acceleration (constant velocity).

 Sketch a velocity-time graph for an object moving in the + direction, accelerat

\begin_layout Standard
Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object moving in the + direction,
 accelerating from a slow speed to a fast speed is shown below.
 An object which is moving in the + direction and speeding up (slow to fast)
 has a + acceleration.
 (If necessary, review the dir'n of the acceleration vector in the Physics
 Classroom Tutorial.) Since the slope of a line on a v-t graph is the object's
 acceleration, an object with + acceleration is represented by a line with
 + slope.
 Thus, the line is a straight diagonal line with upward (+) slope.
 Since the velocity is +, the line is plotted in the + region of the v-t
 graph.

Answer : A velocity-time graph for an object which first moves with a slow,

 Since there are two parts of this object's motion, there will be two distinct
 parts on the graph.
 Each part is in the + region of the v-t graph (above 0) since the velocity
 is +.
 Each part is horizontal since the velocity during each part is constant

 The second part of the graph will be higher since the velocity is greater
 during the second part of the motion.

Solution
\end_layout

\end_inset

 : a.) Remember from problem 22 that velocity is the slope of a position
 vs.
 time graph such as this.
 By looking at lines tangent to the curve, we can see which point has the
 highest and lowest slope:

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the red tangent lines, we can immediately eliminate point B as
 a candidate for both the maximum and minimum velocity, as its tangent is
 horizontal and thus has a slope of 0.
 Point C is the only marked point whose tangent line has a negative slope,
 so point C has the lowest velocity.
 Looking at points A and D, point A's tangent line has a steeper positive
 slope so point A has the highest velocity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b.) We know that acceleration is a change in velocity, so by asking whether
 acceleration is positive or negative, we are asking if the velocity is
 increasing or decreasing.
 Since velocity is the slope of this graph, we must determine how the slope
 of the curve is changing between points A and B.
 Looking at the diagram in part a, we see that the slope at point A is positive,
 and the slope at point B is 0.
 As such, the slope, and thus the velocity, must be decreasing.
 Therefore, the object's acceleration is negative in this interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c.) We know from problem 22 that velocity is the derivative of position,
 and from problem 23 that acceleration is the derivative of velocity.
 So, we will begin by differentiating the position function twice: x(t)
 = t3 - 9.5t2 + 23t - 9 v(t) = 3t2 - 19t + 23 a(t) = 6t - 19
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we know the velocity and acceleration functions, all that is left
 is to plug the values of t into these functions and simplify: v(1) = 3
 * 12 - 19 * 1 + 23 = 3 - 19 + 23 = 7 m/s v(3) = 3 * 32 - 19 * 3 + 23 =
 27 - 57 + 23 = -7 m/s v(5) = 3 * 52 - 19 * 5 + 23 = 75 - 95 + 23 = 3 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a(1) = 6 * 1 - 19 = 6 - 19 = -13 m/s2 a(3) = 6 * 3 - 19 = 18 - 19 = -1 m/s2
 a(5) = 6 * 5 - 19 = 30 - 19 = 11 m/s2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d.) Thinking logically about the graph, the possible candidates for maximum
 and minimum position are at the end points of the interval and at the spots,
 like point B, where the slope of the graph is 0.
 So, first we set the velocity function from part c equal to 0 and solve
 for t: v(t) = 3t2 - 19t + 23 = 0 t = 1.63008 s or t = 4.70326 s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this was solved using a graphing calculator.
 The AP exam will not ask you to solve a quadratic this complicated by hand,
 however you may have to solve a simpler function using the quadratic formula.
 Also, we keep as many decimal places as we can at this stage in order to
 maintain accuracy.
 Now that we know all the possible times at which the position could be
 at a maximum or minimum within the interval, we simply plug these t values
 into x(t).
 Don't forget to check the end points: x(t) = t3 - 9.5t2 + 23t - 9 x(1) =
 5.5 m x(1.63008) = 7.58 m x(4.70326) = -6.93 m x(6) = 3 m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that the minimum position is -6.93 m, and the maximum position is
 7.58 m.
 Finding the maximum and minimum velocities is achieved in the same manner,
 except we set the acceleration function equal to 0 and plug the t values
 into the velocity funtion: a(t) = 6t - 19 = 0 6t = 19 t = 19/6 = 3.16667
 s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v(t) = 3t2 - 19t + 23 v(1) = 7 m/s v(3.16667) = -7.08 m/s v(6) = 17 m/s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the minimum velocity is -7.08 m/s, and the maximum velocity is 17 m/s.

Velocity and acceleration graphs for Problem 1.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The area under the velocity graph is the displacement, which was given to
 be 120 m.
 Breaking the area under graph into a rectangle and a triangle yields 120
 m = v0 3 t + 1 2 Dv 3 t = 2 s 3 v0 + 1 2 20 m/s 3 2 s.
 (2) One can easily solve this for the initial velocity of the object, thus
 obtaining the answer to the problem (50 m/s is a quite unrealistic initial
 velocity for a thrown ball).
 No explicit use of the standard kinematic equations is made; the solution
 is based on only the graphs.
 The above problem is relatively simple; to see the real power of the method
 requires a more difficult 1-D kinematics problem.

Example 4

 : Determined to test gravity, a student walks off the cN Tower in Toronto,
 which is 553 m high, and falls freely.
 His initial velocity is zero.
 The rocketeer arrives at the roof of the building 5 seconds later to save
 the student.
 The rocketeer leaves the roof with an initial velocity downward and then
 is in freefall.
 in order both to catch the student and to prevent injury to him, the rocketeer
 should catch the student at a sufficiently great height and arrive at the
 ground with zero velocity.
 The upward acceleration that accomplishes this is provided by the rocketeer’s
 jet pack, which he turns on just as he catches the student; before then
 the student is in freefall.
 To prevent discomfort to the student, the magnitude of the acceleration
 is limited to five times gravity.
 How high above the ground must the rocketeer catch the student?

Solution
\end_layout

\end_inset

 : As I was grading the assignment, one student’s solution stuck out.
 When I first saw it, I was convinced that something must be wrong as the
 problem had been difficult for me and could not be that simple.
 I was wrong.
 The simple solution consists of sketching the velocity and acceleration
 graphs for the falling student (Fig.
 2; down is taken as the positive direction) and using a bit of reasoning.
 Since the overall change in the student’s velocity during his motion is
 zero, the total area under the acceleration-versus-time graph must equal
 zero.
 This area consists of a positive part (above the time axis) and a negative
 part (below the time axis).
 The two rectangular areas must have equal magnitude, and since their heights
 differ by a factor of 5, so must their widths (the two corresponding times).
 Therefore, the freefall time is five times longer than the time for slow-down
 to rest.
 Now, looking at the velocity graph, the area labeled 1 corresponds to the
 displacement while in freefall, and the area labeled 2 represents the displacem
ent after the Rocketeer has caught the student.
 The triangles forming areas 1 and 2 have the same height, and the base
 (time) for area 1 is five times the base (time) for area 2.
 Therefore, area 1 must be five times larger than area 2.
 This means that area 2 must be 1/6 the total height of the building, or
 92.2 m.

\begin_layout Standard
After studying this solution for a long time and finding no flaws in the
 physics, I pulled out my physics book and tried solving other one-dimensional
 kinematics problems in a similar manner.
 It quickly became obvious that they could be done using graphs, and in
 most cases this is the easier method.
 I was hooked and began teaching one-dimensional problem solving this way
 in all my classes.
 The next class period I asked the student whose solution this was why he
 chose to do the problem this way.
 He explained that we had emphasized graphs so much in class that they must
 be more useful than something we are simply supposed to sketch for the
 problems.
 I was amazed and appreciative as I now had a new way to teach problem solving.
 This kind of solution is more visual and helps get students away from hunting
 for the “correct equation.” It has worked well for me at all levels of introduct
ory physics, conceptual through calculus based.
 If you find other interesting problems that are especially suited to the
 above method, I would appreciate your sharing them.

Change in Momentum or the "Impulse" 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The change in the momentum of a system (or the impulse delivered by the
 net force) is given mathematically by the Momentum Principle, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\overrightarrow{p}=\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\triangle t$
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this form, the change in momentum is calculated over a “discrete” time
 step.
 That is, the calculation is done over a known or determined time interval.
 If the force is non-constant (i.e., depends on location or velocity), this
 calculation is not exact.
 In fact, in this case, the net force is the average net force over the
 time interval.
 So that a better definition is this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\overrightarrow{p}=\overrightarrow{F_{net,avg}}\triangle t$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This definition works well for case where you might use iterative procedures
 to determine the change in momentum over small time intervals.
 If on the other hand, you can analytically integrate the force (e.g., it
 is or can be put into a form which is time dependent), then you can use
 the derivative form of the Momentum Principle,
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $Δ\overrightarrow{p}=\intop_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}\overset{\rightarrow}{F}_{net}dt$

In any event, either (or both) can be useful to think about graphs of force
 vs time.

\begin_layout Subsection
Force vs Time Graphs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some situations, it is easier to empirically measure force versus time
 graphs because the situations lend themselves more easily to these empirical
 measurements rather than what might be more complex physical theories.
 This is true in different engineering contexts (e.g., impact design and the
 flow of fluids).
 In these cases, you are interested in determining the change in momentum
 (and thus the velocity) of the system in question1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below is a force vs time graph where the “area under the curve” has been
 highlighted.
 In this example, we are only looking at the component of the net force
 in the xx-direction.
 Such graphs can be produced for each component of the net force, but let's
 say that for this system, there was a non-zero component of the net force
 only in the x-direction.

For the above figure, the momentum change over the complete time interval
 can be determined in a straightforward way due to the simple geometric
 shapes produced.
 Area above the zero line are positive momentum changes, and area below
 are negative.
 By adding up the “area under the curve” in this way, we obtain a momentum
 change of 7 Ns.

The figure below shows the force vs time graph for another system.
 In this case, the graph has a smooth form, which doesn't appear to be analytic.
 The “area under the curve” for this graph could be analyzed computationally,

 be determined.

Question Modern cars are designed to crumple on impact in a collision.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer The change in momentum (area under the force time graph) can't be
 changed at the time of the accident (mass is fixed and it is too late for
 the driver to slow down!) By increasing the time of collision the peak
 force is less and hopefully lets the occupants come to less harm as a result.

Static frictional forces from the interlocking of the irregularities of

\begin_layout Standard
In making a distinction between static and kinetic coefficients of friction,
 we are dealing with an aspect of "real world" common experience with a
 phenomenon which cannot be simply characterized.
 The difference between static and kinetic coefficients obtained in simple
 experiments like wooden blocks sliding on wooden inclines roughly follows
 the model depicted in the friction plot from which the illustration above
 is taken.
 This difference may arise from irregularities, surface contaminants, etc.
 which defy precise description.
 When such experiments are carried out with smooth metal blocks which are
 carefully cleaned, the difference between static and kinetic coefficients
 tends to disappear.
 When coefficients of friction are quoted for specific surface combinations
 are quoted, it is the kinetic coefficient which is generally quoted since
 it is the more reliable number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Kinetic Friction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When two surfaces are moving with respect to one another, the frictional
 resistance is almost constant over a wide range of low speeds, and in the
 standard model of friction the frictional force is described by the relationshi
p below.
 The coefficient is typically less than the coefficient of static friction,
 reflecting the common experience that it is easier to keep something in
 motion across a horizontal surface than to start it in motion from rest.

Having taken a large number of students through this experiment, I can report
 that the coefficient of static friction obtained is almost always greater
 than the coefficient of kinetic friction.

 and 0.3 for the kinetic coefficient.

\begin_layout Standard
When carefully standardized surfaces are used to measure the friction coefficien
ts, the difference between static and kinetic coefficients tends to disappear,
 indicating that the difference may have to do with irregular surfaces,
 impurities, or other factors which can be frustratingly non-reproducible.
 To quote a view counter to the above model of friction: "Many people believe
 that the friction to be overcome to get something started (static friction)
 exceeds the force required to keep it sliding (sliding friction), but with
 dry metals it is very hard to show any difference.
 The opinion probably arises from experiences where small bits of oil or
 lubricant are present, or where blocks, for example, are supported by springs
 or other flexible supports so that they appear to bind." R.

Rolling Friction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A rolling wheel requires a certain amount of friction so that the point
 of contact of the wheel with the surface will not slip.
 The amount of traction which can be obtained for an auto tire is determined
 by the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road.
 If the wheel is locked and sliding, the force of friction is determined
 by the coefficient of kinetic friction and is usually significantly less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that a wheel is rolling without slipping, the surface friction
 does no work against the motion of the wheel and no energy is lost at that
 point.
 However, there is some loss of energy and some deceleration from friction
 for any real wheel, and this is sometimes referred to as rolling friction.
 It is partly friction at the axle and can be partly due to flexing of the
 wheel which will dissipate some energy.
 Figures of 0.02 to 0.06 have been reported as effective coefficients of rolling
 friction for automobile tires, compared to about 0.8 for the maximum static
 friction coefficient between the tire and the road.

 We assume that the force being exerted on the object was always the same,
 causing a constant acceleration.
 If we are looking at a simple impulse question (where the force is constant),
 we can figure out exactly what we can interpret from a graph.
 • Later this may help us to figure out a more complicated question, like
 if the force changes.
 The following graph is an example of one of those simple situations where
 the force remains constant during the entire time.
 • If we look at what the slope might represent, we get...

 over time, the slope doesn't mean anything to us in this situation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we really wanted to, we could have simply use Δp = FΔt to figure out
 the impulse.
 We could do this in this situation because the force is constant.
 • If we need to do a question where the force is not constant, we can still
 use the area under the line to get the impulse, even though the formula
 Δp = FΔt can not be used.

Even if the graph is a curved line, you can still at least estimate the
 area under the graph.
 • Although this will only be an approximate area, without getting into
 calculus it's as good as you'll get and as good as you need.
 ◦ On the graph shown below we have an s-curve that would be difficult to
 calculate the exact area of.
 ◦ Instead, we just look at the triangle drawn in red.
 For the little bit extra it has near the beginning, it misses a bit later
 on.
 These two parts should more or less make up for each other, so that the
 area of the triangle will be about the same as the area under the curve.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EXPLORATION – An impulsive bike ride Suki is riding her bicycle, in a straight
 line, along a flat road.
 Suki and her bike have a combined mass of 50 kg.
 At t = 0, Suki is traveling at 8.0 m/s.
 Suki coasts for 10 seconds, but when she realizes she is slowing down,
 she pedals for the next 20 seconds.
 Suki pedals so that the static friction force exerted on the bike by the
 road increases linearly with time from 0 to 40 N, in the direction Suki
 is traveling, over that 20-second period.
 Assume there is constant 10 N resistive force, from air resistance and
 other factors, acting on her and the bicycle the entire time.
 Step 1 - Sketch a diagram of the situation.
 The diagram is shown in Figure 6.2, along with the free-body diagram that
 applies for the first 10 s and the free-body diagram that applies for the
 20second period while Suki is pedaling.

\end_inset

 gradually increases because of the way Suki pedals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 2 - Sketch a graph of the net force acting on Suki and her bicycle
 as a function of time.
 Take the positive direction to be the direction Suki is traveling.
 In the vertical direction, the normal force exactly balances the force
 of gravity, so we can focus on the horizontal forces.
 For the first 10 seconds, we have only the 10 N resistive force, which
 acts to oppose the motion and is thus in the negative direction.
 For the next 20 seconds, we have to account for the friction force that
 acts in the direction of motion and the resistive force.
 We can account for their combined effect by drawing a straight line that
 goes from –10 N at t = 10 s, to +30 N (40 N – 10N) at t = 30 s.
 The result is shown in Figure 6.3.

Step 3 - What is Suki’s speed at t = 10 s? Let’s apply Equation 6.3, which
 we can write as: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{\rightarrow}{F_{net}}\text{∆}t=\text{∆}(m\overset{\rightarrow}{v})=m\text{∆}\overrightarrow{v}=m(\overrightarrow{v_{10s}}-\overrightarrow{v_{i}})$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving for the velocity at t = 10 s gives: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{v_{10s}}=\overrightarrow{v_{i}}+\dfrac{\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\triangle t}{m}=+8.0m/s+\dfrac{(-10N)(10s)}{50kg}=+8.0m/s-2.0m/s=+6.0m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, Suki’s speed at t = 10 s is 6.0 m/s.
 We can also obtain this result from the forceversus-time graph, by recognizing
 that the impulse, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\text{∆}t$
\end_inset

 , represents the area under this graph over some time interval ∆t .
 Let’s find the area under the graph, over the first 10 seconds, shown highlight
ed in green in Figure 6.4.
 The area is negative, because the net force is negative over that time
 interval.
 The area under the graph is the impulse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F_{net}}\text{∆}t=-10N\times10s=-100Ns=-100kg\;m/s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 6.4: The green rectangle represents the area under the graph for the
 first 10 s.
 The area is negative, because the force is negative.
 From Equation 6.3, we know the impulse is equal to the change in momentum.

Step 4 - What is Suki’s speed at t = 30 s? Let’s use the area under the
 force-versus-time graph, between t = 10 s and t = 30 s, to find Suki’s
 change in momentum over that 20-second period.
 This area is highlighted in Figure 6.5, split into a negative area for the
 time between t = 10 s and t = 15 s, and a positive area between t = 15
 s and t = 30 s.
 These regions are triangles, so we can use the equation for the area of
 a triangle, 0.5 × base × height .
 The area under the curve, between 10 s and 15 s, is 0.5 × (5.0s) ×( - 10
 N) = - 25kg m/s .
 The area between 15 s and 30 s is 0.5 × (15s) × (30 N) = + 225kg m/s .
 The total area (total change in momentum) is +200 kg m/s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that another approach is to multiply the average net force acting on
 Suki and the bicycle (+10 N) over this interval, by the time interval (20
 s), for a +200 kg m/s change in momentum.

\begin_layout Standard
In step 3, we determined that Suki’s momentum at t = 10 s is +300 kg m/s.
 With the additional 200 kg m/s, the net momentum at t = 10 s is +500 kg
 m/s.
 Dividing by the 50 kg mass gives a velocity at t = 30 s of +10 m/s.
 
\end_layout

Key idea for the graphical interpretation of impulse: The area under the
 net force versus time graph for a particular time interval is equal to
 the change in momentum during that time interval.

Position vs time 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graph of position verse time is a sine wave with a possible phase shift.
 The phase shift is how much the ahead or behind the position is on the
 sine wave.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider this graph, if the "clock" is started at 0.05 (where the mass is
 at it's maximum stretch) seconds then there would be a phase shift of 90
 degrees (or we could replace the sine function for a cosine).
 If the "clock" is started at 0.1 seconds (where mass moves down instead
 of up; left instead of right) then the phase shift would be 180 degrees
 (a negative sine function).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Velocity vs time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the position verses time graph, at any point were the mass has
 reached the amplitude (maximum distance from from the equilibrium point)
 the speed of the mass at these point is zero.
 When the position is at zero then the speed is at a maximum (if you don't
 believe it, consider conservation of energy).
 This "shifts" the position graph by 90 degrees "creating" a cosine graph
 for velocity.
 The other way of thinking about is velocity is the change in position with
 respect to time, the change in a sine wave with respect to time is a cosine
 graph.

Acceleration vs time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The acceleration verse time graph is the easiest of the graphs to make.
 The simple harmonic motion is based on a relationship between position
 and acceleration; x = - Ka.
 So the graph of position and acceleration should look alike, except for
 the negative sign.
 In fact position and acceleration are the same shape just mirror copies
 of each other.

Peak Height
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that the shapes of each graph is simular, that each
 graph has the same frequency, period and wavelength, but they don't have
 the same amplitude, for common simple harmonic motion, the height the peak
 of the function (not to confused with the amplitude, amplitude refers to
 the height of the position graph alone, i'm talking about the height of
 the position, velocity and acceleration graphs) tend to get smaller and
 smaller starting with the position graph being the tallest and the acceleration
 being the shortest.

\begin_layout Section
Graphing position, velocity, and acceleration with respect to each other
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphing position to the other functions can be complicated and when tested
 on it, most student are unable to give the right answer.
 First consider this, for simple harmonic motion position and acceleration
 are proportional.
 x = -k a this is a linear relationship so the graph is a line, the slope
 is negative so the line is heading down.

Position and acceleration verses velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The position and acceleration verse velocity graph look entirely different.
 First off the straight line test fails when plotting position vs velocity
 or acceleration verse velocity.
 Take the point were x and a are zero, there are two possible answers for
 the point (the speed maybe at maximum) the object could be moving down
 or up at the point.
 That means the velocity can be a positive maximum or a negative maximum,
 two separate values.
 Looking a the points were the velocity is equal to zero, there are two
 possible answers, either at the top or at the bottom.
 If you continue to plot data points graph that is developed is a ellisipe

Paragraph 1: When a particle of mass m moves on the x-axis in a potential

 it performs simple harmonic motion.
 The corresponding time period is proportional to

, as can be seen easily using dimensional analysis.
 However, the motion of a particle can be periodic even when its potential
 energy increases on both sides of x=0 in a way different from

 and its total energy is such that the particle does not escape to infinity.

Paragraph 1: Electrical resistance of certain materials, known as superconductor
s, changes abruptly from a nonzero value to zero as their temperature is
 lowered below a critical temperature Tc(0).
 An intersting property of superconductors is that their critical temperatre
 becomes smaler than Tc(0) if they are placed in a magnetic field, i.e., the
 critical temperature Tc(B) is a function of the magnetic field strength
 B.
 The dependence of Tc(B) on B is shown in the figure.

Two trains A and B are moving with speed 20 m/s and 30 m/s respectively
 in the same direction on the same straight track, with B ahead of A.
 The engines are at the front ends.
 The engine of train A blows a long whistle.
 Assume that the sound of the whistle is composed of components varying

Theory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During his experiments on electromagnetic radiation (to demonstrate light
 consists of e-m waves), Hertz noticed a spark between the two metallic
 balls when a high frequency radiation incident on it.
 This is called photoelectric effect.
 Photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons when electromagnetic
 radiations having sufficient frequency incident on certain metal surfaces.
 We call the emitted electrons as photoelectrons and the current they constitute
 as photocurrent.
 The phenomenon was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1880 and explained
 by Albert Einstein in 1905 using Max Planck's quantum theory of light.
 As the first experiment which demonstrated the quantum theory of energy
 levels, photoelectric effect experiment is of great historical importance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The important observations on Photoelectric effect which demand quantum
 theory for its explanation are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 The Photoelectric effect is an instantaneous phenomenon.
 There is no time delay between the incidence of light and emission of photoelec
trons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 The number of photoelectrons emitted is proportional to the intensity of
 incident light.
 Also, the energy of emitted photoelectrons is independent of the intensity
 of incident light.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 The energy of emitted photoelectrons is directly proportional to the frequency
 of incident light.
 The basic experimental set up which explains Photoelectric effect is as
 given below,

dilemma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the right circumstances light can be used to push electrons, freeing
 them from the surface of a solid.
 This process is called the photoelectric effect (or photoelectric emission
 or photoemission), a material that can exhibit this phenomena is said to
 be photoemissive, and the ejected electrons are called photoelectrons;
 but there is nothing that would distinguish them from other electrons.
 All electrons are identical to one another in mass, charge, spin, and magnetic
 moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The photoelectric effect was first observed in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894
) during experiments with a spark-gap generator (the earliest form of radio
 receiver).
 In these experiments, a spark is generated between two small metal spheres
 in the transmitter to induce a similar spark to jump between two different
 metal spheres in the receiver.
 Compared to later radio devices, the spark-gap generator was notoriously
 difficult to work with.
 The air gap would often have to be smaller than a millimeter for a the
 receiver to consistently reproduce the spark of the transmitter.
 Hertz found that he could increase the sensitivity of his spark-gap device
 by illuminating it with visible or ultraviolet light.
 Later studies by J.J.
 Thomson (1856–1940) showed that this increased sensitivity was the result
 of light pushing on electrons (which he discovered in 1897).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this is interesting, it is hardly amazing.
 All forms of electromagnetic radiation transport energy and it is quite
 easy to imagine this energy being used to push tiny particles of negative
 charge free from the surface of a metal where they are not all that strongly
 confined in the first place.
 The era of modern physics is one of completely unexpected and inexplicable
 discoveries, however.
 Subsequent investigations into the photoelectric effect yielded results
 that did not fit with the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation.
 When it interacted with electrons, light just didn't behave like it was
 supposed to.
 Repairing this tear in theory required more than just a patch.
 It meant rebuilding a large portion of physics from the ground up.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was Philipp Lenard (1862–1947), an assistant of Hertz, who performed
 the earliest, definitive studies of the photoelectric effect.
 Lenard used metal surfaces that were first cleaned and then held under
 a vacuum so that the effect might be studied on the metal alone and not
 be affected by any surface contaminants or oxidation.
 The metal sample was housed in an evacuated glass tube with a second metal
 plate mounted at the opposite end.
 The tube was then positioned or constrained in some manner so that light
 would only shine on the first metal plate — the one made out of photoemissive
 material under investigation.
 Such a tube is called a photocell (formally) or an electric eye (informally).
 Lenard connected his photocell to a circuit with a variable power supply,
 voltmeter, and microammeter as shown in the schematic diagram above.
 He then illuminated the photoemissive surface with light of differing frequenci
es and intensities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knocking electrons free from the photoemissive plate would give it a slight
 positive charge.
 Since the second plate was connected to the first by the wiring of the
 circuit, it too would become positive, which would then attract the photoelectr
ons floating freely through the vacuum where they would land and return
 back to the plate from which they started.
 Keep in mind that this experiment doesn't create electrons out of light,
 it just uses the energy of the light to push electrons that are already
 there around the circuit.
 The photoelectric current generated by this means was quite small, but
 could be measured with the microammeter (a sensitive galvanometer with
 a maximum deflection of only a few microamps).
 It also serves as a measure of the rate at which photoelectrons are leaving
 the surface of the photoemissive material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note how the power supply is wired into the circuit — with its negative
 end connected to the plate that isn't illuminated.
 This sets up a potential difference that tries to push the photoelectrons
 back into the photoemissive surface.
 When the power supply is set to a low voltage it traps the least energetic
 electrons, reducing the current through the microammeter.
 Increasing the voltage drives increasingly more energetic electrons back
 until finally none of them are able to leave the metal surface and the
 microammeter reads zero.
 The potential at which this occurs is called the stopping potential.
 It is a measure of the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons emitted
 as a result of the photoelectric effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What Lenard found was that the intensity of the incident light had no effect
 on the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons.
 Those ejected from exposure to a very bright light had the same energy
 as those ejected from exposure to a very dim light of the same frequency.
 In keeping with the law of conservation of energy, however, more electrons
 were ejected by a bright source than a dim source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later experiments by others, most notably the American physicist Robert
 Millikan (1865–1953), found that light with frequencies below a certain
 cutoff value, called the threshold frequency, would not eject photoelectrons
 from the metal surface no matter how bright the source.
 These result were completely unexpected.
 Given that it is possible to move electrons with light and given that the
 energy in a beam of light is related to its intensity, classical physics
 would predict that a more intense beam of light would eject electrons with
 greater energy than a less intense beam no matter what the frequency.
 This was not the case, however.

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, maybe these results aren't all that typical.
 Most elements have threshold frequencies that are ultraviolet and only
 a few dip down low enough to be green or yellow like the example shown
 above.
 The materials with the lowest threshold frequencies are all semiconductors.
 Some have threshold frequencies in the infrared region of the spectrum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classical model of light describes it as a transverse, electromagnetic
 wave.
 Of this there was very little doubt at the end of the Nineteenth Century.
 The wave nature of light was confirmed when it was applied successfully
 to explain such optical phenomena as diffraction, interference, polarization,
 reflection and refraction.
 If we can imagine light as waves in an electromagnetic ocean and be quite
 successful at it, then it wouldn't be much of a stretch for us to image
 electrons in a metal surface as something like tethered buoys floating
 in an electromagnetic harbor.
 Along come the waves (light) which pull and tug at the buoys (electrons).
 Weak waves have no effect, but strong ones just might yank a buoy from
 their mooring and set it adrift.
 A wave model of light would predict an energy–amplitude relationship and
 not the energy–frequency relationship described above.
 Photoelectric experiments describe an electromagnetic ocean where monstrous
 swells wouldn't tip over a canoe, but tiny ripples would fling you into
 the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If that wasn't enough, the photoelectrons seem to pop out of the surface
 too quickly.
 When light intensities are very low, the rate at which energy is delivered
 to to the surface is downright sluggish.
 It should take a while for any one particular electron to capture enough
 of this diffuse energy to free itself.
 It should, but it doesn't.
 The instant that light with an appropriate frequency of any intensity strikes
 a photoemissive surface, at least one electron will always pop out immediately
 (t < 10−9 s).
 Continuing with the ocean analogy, imagine a harbor full of small boats
 (electrons).
 The sea is calm except for tiny ripples on the surface (low intensity,
 short wavelength light).
 Most of the boats in the harbor are unaffected by these waves, but one
 is ripped from the harbor and sent flying upward like a jet aircraft.
 Something just ain't right here.
 No mechanical waves behave like this, but light does.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
new idea
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two factors affecting maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons are the
 frequency of the incident radiation and the material on the surface.
 As shown in the graph below, electron energy increases with frequency in
 a simple linear manner above the threshold.
 All three curves have the same slope (equal to Planck's constant) which
 shows that the energy–frequency relation is constant for all materials.
 Below the threshold frequency photoemission does not occur.
 Each curve has a different intercept on the energy axis, which shows that
 threshold frequency is a function of the material.

The genius that figured out what was going on here was none other than the
 world's most famous physicist Albert Einstein.
 In 1905, Einstein realized that light was behaving as if it was composed
 of tiny particles (initially called quanta and later called photons) and
 that the energy of each particle was proportional to the frequency of the
 electromagnetic radiation that it was a part of.
 Recall from the previous section of this book that Max Planck invented
 the notion of quantized electromagnetic radiation as a way to solve a technical
 problem with idealized sources of electromagnetic radiation called blackbodies.
 Recall also that Planck did not believe that radiation was actually broken
 up into little bits as his mathematical analysis showed.
 He thought the whole thing was just a contrivance that gave him the right
 answers.
 The genius of Einstein was in recognizing that Planck's contrivance was
 in fact a resonable description of reality.
 What we perceive as a continuous wave of electromagnetic radiation is in
 reality a stream of discrete particles.

\begin_layout Standard
The next graph shows the distance between the object and image (u+v) plotted
 against the object distance (u) (it could equally well have been v).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimum value for (u+v) is 4f when u=v=2f.
 This means that no image can be formed with a convex lens of focal length
 10 cm if the object and the screen are closer than 40 cm.
