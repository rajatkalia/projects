KINETIC ENERGY 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects have energy because of their motion; this energy is called kinetic
 energy.
 Kinetic energy of the objects having mass m and velocity v can be calculated
 with the formula given below; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $E_{k}=\dfrac{1}{2}mv²$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you see from the formula, kinetic energy of the objects is only affected
 by the mass and velocity of the objects.
 The unit of the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{k}$
\end_inset

 is again from the formula kg.m²/s² or in general use joule.

\begin_layout Standard
The area under the graph from zero to 20 meters is 300 N m.
 Thus, the force represented by the graph does 300 J of work.
 This work is also a measure of the energy which was transferred while the
 force was being applied

\begin_layout Standard
The area under the net force vs.

 net work).
